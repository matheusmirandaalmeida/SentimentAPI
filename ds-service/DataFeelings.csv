Aesop provides a very generous starting hourly wage and up to thirty hours a week for part time. They provide monthly and yearly bonuses and free products regularly. The products are truly what they claim to be and the company does stand strong to its ethics and morals through and through. They provide food in store everyday and celebratory dinners twice a year.,1

"Wonderful people to work with, the company feels more like a team than a job.",1
"Very poor management, especially middle management.  The company is experiencing somewhat of a crisis.  Exodus of good employees. Management is taking pains to hide the departures (e.g., farewell emails are highly discouraged and only allowed with manager approval).  The company strongly discourages feedback from ICs and has an elitist attitude.  Company is run by academics who have a difficult time making decisions.  Everything has to be A/B tested before rolled out.  If employees give honest feedback, the feedback is usually downplayed, and the employee reprimanded or terminated as they perceive it reflects a bad attitude.  Unless you went to Harvard, Stanford, or Yale, don't expect to be promoted.",0
"Being a remote-first company, I was only able to meet my team members a couple times but this was wonderful memories when we did have the opportunity to meet from across the country. Was sad to be part of the tech layoffs but I'm grateful for the short but sweet time I had with this B-Corp.",0

I think I learned the most from TOMS because they still run their shops like small mom and pops shops. I received a great deal of experience in running a small business. Their HR team was super amazing. Loved how I had access to the entire retail team including HR to your allocation teams. The trip out of the country was life changing and will never forget that. New owner seems to deeply care and have a extensive experience in retail. I'm excited for the company in the years to follow.,1

Weekends are busy, not so easy to get a full two day weekend off. Unfortunately high amount of work gossip and irrelevant side talk, offensive and distracting and eats away at that family atmosphere you felt at first, soon feeling like a shark fight. I did not receive much official product training until about my 5th Month, they leave you on your own with that resulting in frustrating customer interactions when you can not properly describe a product to your customer. No supplemental training tools where provided.",0
Great mission Good compensation & benefits Individual access to Coursera courses and for Friends & Family 2 Global work weeks off in the year,1
"Monthly opportunities to earn sales incentive bonuses, working with high quality products, excellent benefits, received free good 3 times a year.",1
"TOMS is a company that is young and entrepreneurial. The people here are collaborative and genuinely care about each other and the company. The environment is relaxed and playful - you can typically find dogs to play with or a game of ping pong going on. Company events (""TOMS Holidays"") are held as sacred and are held each year, without fail. TOMS ensures that we have a lot of opportunities to connect and build relationships as a company.

I'm going to disagree with a lot of the other posts I've read on this site. I see that a great deal of posts complain about internal growth/career opportunities. From what I see at TOMS, employees feel that after having been with the company for a few years (often it was their first job out of college) that they are entitled to a promotion, even if they sincerely lack the skills/abilities for that next-level role. They think it's a given because they are passionate about the brand. Often managers are in the position to have to look externally because the skill set just doesn't exist in-house. We have a lot of passionate people who think they've got the skill set, but the reality is, they just don't.

Advice to all current TOMS employees: have an opinion about your career. Know what you want to do and go after it. Stop waiting for your manager (or HR) to hand it to you. The opportunities are there -- you just have to go and grab them.",1
"In spite of its maturity there are still aspects of the company that are start-up like. This includes growth spurts to flux in head count, management, and changes to house rules. Regardless, the growth is understandable and if you can accept that and roll with the punches then its all good.",0
Not much opportunity for growth from Sm to corporate,0
"The higher management are horrific. Constantly giving illegal shifts, bullying members of staff, harassing them and just in general being truly horrible people. You get screamed at for their mistakes and the bar manager is a truly unkind and straight up rude individual. You get treated like you've just defecated on their shoes and they're all so condescending and unpleasant. Staff turnover rate is insane and it's not a suprise no-one stays longer than a few months. If you want to be ridiculed, bullied and tormented constantly then this is the place for you. James watt constantly brings in his hook-ups and is unpleasant to staff and the manager stress out even more when he's around.",0

The company is very principled and really works to treat both its people and users well. We do what we think is right and aren't beholden to any investors or shareholders since the founders and employees retain control. I really really like every single person at the company. Amazing group of people.,1
"Your experience really depends on your coworkers. Luckily, I loved mine! If you are not comfortable working alone in the shop, or only with one person this isnt for you. Personally, I liked the freedom and learned some team management skills.",0
"The pay isn’t something to live off of. This is meant to be a high school / summer job with the wage of $13/hr,",0
"If you work in retail for this company, there's little to no room for growth. If you wish to work for corporate, they encourage internships (unpaid) that don't result in any kind of job offer after. I expressed multiple times before graduating my career goals, and all they offered me was assistant store manager (which in Aesop world, is pretty low on the totem pole). They're also very strict about their ""Aesop"" ways, and it's hard to convince them of other ideas. Can be super strict if managers or corporate people are around.",0
"They really look after their staff - beer allowance, healthcare, childcare vouchers etc..

Fast paced environment",1
Co-workers; benefits (though these have been getting slowly chipped away at over the last couple of years).,1
"None to speak of, really.",0
"From my experience, this was not a good place for women to work. There are a lot of publicly treasured golden boys who walk on water. Regardless of the many ""stats"" that may be shared with the employees that appear to show how edX is a great place for all who work there, what you cannot quantify is how the women are treated by male leadership and by their peers, when nobody is watching. That cannot be put into a graph, because nobody actually collected that data. You get what you measure. 

Being ""a great place to work for women"" is more than just offering a certain amount of maternity leave that is better than the average; that is a fancy trick to distract you from the real issues. How are the men treating the women when there aren't any witnesses? I didn't see this question on the engagement survey, and even if it were, nobody did anything with that engagement survey data anyway, did they? The ""First Rule of Data Collection"" should be ""Only collect data if you're really going to use it"".

Things took a turn for the worse after two very down-to-earth senior leaders departed the company. It changed the tenor of the entire operation.  I experienced and witnessed the biases towards the men here, and my female coworkers and I knew we would get nowhere sharing this with any remaining leadership. There are other companies where you might actually have a fair shot as a woman; this is not the place.",0

-EFP’s (shareholders) come for a drink and are extremely rude quite often, talk to you as if they own the place as they ‘pay your wage’ (they don’t).
-Head offices tell you about events that often include giving out free beer, meaning that they will be very busy events, with less than 24hr notice.",0

"• High turnover in Management due to upper management. 
• Upper Management / Head Office staff are unbelievably awful to deal with and make everything difficult 
• Store Managers are unable to make decisions on their own. If you want to be a real manager - this is not the place for you. 
• You are to adhere to rules made in the 1990’s. If you dare to even suggest the slightest change, for an actual example “I have years worth of customer records on paper, just laying around - could I please have a small box to file them in? Possibly this $6 one from Officeworks?” You are hit with absolutely outrageous responses. The request must be put through and approved by Retail Ops. Who then send your request to your RBM, and also the Head of Retail Ops, and then they ask you … in a email including everyone they can think of, why? What size is the box? Where do you plan to put this box? Please send a photo of where you are thinking of putting this box. As if you wouldn’t know to store an A4 size $6 box in a cupboard or drawer. This went back and forth for 6 weeks before a phone conversation had to be had about it. 
That’s not an exaggeration. That’s a factual example. 
• Every part of your management style and previous skills are ignored. Aēsop wants you to conform. It’s their way or the highway. No personal belongings. Not your own drink bottle - you must only drink from Aēsop cups (recycled candle holders). No pens to be used unless they are black. No individually wrapped foods (even if it’s your own from home) The list is endless 
• There is close to zero chance of making your budget / bonus. There is no incentive to staff to work towards their targets. 
• You are isolated. Deliberately. All of your communication comes from your RBM. They limit your interactions with other managers. Very deliberately. 
• You are subjected to endless training sessions and visits from Trainers, who understandably must justify their wages, however, you and your staff are treated like Kindergarten students who are learning to behave for the first time. 
• Every single thing happening in the business is gate-kept. Like it’s going to change the world. 
• You do a mini stocktake once a week, if you get it wrong - that’s totally fine. You just give a reason or state “idk why” and that’s acceptable. If you get it right - exactly right more than 1 week in a row - someone will be sent out to count on your behalf. No one can ever be right.
* HR are unhelpful and will avoid as much as they can. When an incident arises, they will refer you to the EAP and leave you with it. An example, whilst being stalked and harassed by a physically abusive staff member, involving the police - not one time was support given from any upper management or HR. The staff member in question was put on 2 months of paid leave whilst the victims were made to make 4 statements and were constantly required to be on call, outside of their working hours. 
* Getting any assistance outside of Upper Management’s rigid business hours of 8.30-5 Monday to Friday is impossible. 
* The buildings are all in dire need of maintenance. Leaking taps, leaking sinks, leaking air conditioners. Mould is rampant through the buildings. Insects are everywhere. Some stores don’t even have working air conditioning and are extremely hot or freezing cold. The smells are repugnant and you’re told to cover it up with oil burners, candles and incense. 
* Work Health and Safety is only new to the companies policies and procedures. As long as it looks good, no one in Aēsop cares. Safework NSW have become involved but no one is allowed to talk to anyone about it. 
None of this is an exaggeration. All of this is factual. I could list many, many more things. I would not return to this company for $1million per day. I have not experienced anything like this place in my entire life. Don’t fall for it. They make it sound great. It’s not. Not in Sydney. Ask about the turnover, and dig deeper. Contact former staff members on LnkdIn. Ask them. Don’t do this to yourself, your family or your career.",0

"There are clear favorites in every department or business segments. I've seen people get promoted every year or at least 1 promotion every two years. Others are overlooked, told they need to do more, but not given more work or opportunities to shine. So, basically how well can you manage up? How many meetings can you go to and show your face, put yourself out there, get known, build alliances with others so when they have their year end review, people say great things about you. The performance review is somewhat of a joke. I'm glad it is no longer discretionary and most of it is based on EBITDA. The company is running slim and there are still going to be some more layoffs. I still gave this company 3 stars because I for the most part enjoyed my time at TOMS. Every place is political, I just don't think you have to be an a%$ kisser to get ahead at ALL companies. Titles don't mean much just dictates your pay. A lot of top heavy positions, but not enough senior level employees to put in the hard work. Product is not that great, but they've put a lot of money on future seasons so maybe that will change. Lastly, at the end of the day, TOMS is a for profit business. They try to portray that they are contributing so much to help children, but they could easily just donate the money to those communities. People need food and water, paved roads, better infrastructure, not a pair of shoes which are the cheapest kind they purchase. It's the classic, give a man a fish, but don't teach him to be a fisherman. Change the give model to donate real resources and not shoes because it's 2017, A LOT of companies give back as part of their business model now!",0

Trainings intended to build a consultant's own style of presenting without being didactic, instead encouraging you to blend and try products yourself and share them to clients as you would a friend hosted in your home. For instance, the price range is on the lower end of luxury cosmetics, and yet they have been able to achieve a B Corp certification, collaborate with an Indigenous-run sandalwood farm for sourcing, support the growth of new disruptors within the industry with a venture fund, and reduce waste significantly by, among other things, using Australian recyclable waste with a splash of brown dye for their signature Hand Wash bottles. Aesthetics and ingredients will leave you inspired when you finish your shift. *The* ideal student job, I would say, down to the supportive salary, interesting and diverse employees and development of soft skills (through projects that you set for yourself with your manager).

As an engineer, if we need to modify timelines managers are generally understanding and will back you up instead of pressuring you.

The layoffs in November 2022 were sudden and leadership could have had a transparent plan in place to share for how we will move forward and ideally avoid this situation again. It has taken a few months to mentally recover from losing colleagues and the 2023 economic environment in tech is still worrisome. Remote-first means you have to focus on building relationships with peers and across departments in this environment. You have to be outgoing to show your impact. Very high standards for performance and being remote-first means you can feel isolated and stressed if you do not find the proper outlets. Many layers of management on Enterprise makes it hard to feel seen unless working on high visibility/impact accounts.,0

The future does not look good today. They have been having random group lay-offs for the past 3 years. No one should feel secure in their position here.

"This is a small company with a sprawling national footprint. The owners are very good at purchasing franchises. They are not good at managing. The bottom line will mean more than work-life balance. There is no work-life balance, actually, busy or off-season. They use the word family a lot but that isn't actually a priority. Making money is, which is the name of the game but you don't retain employees like that. You will have to manage your career path as there isn't an active development program for careers unless you want to be a franchise owner. That leans towards the men. There are no female franchise owners. I never or seen them develop any female employees for franchise ownership (I know they inquired). 

You have a strong DEI committment. That should apply to women of color in senior leadership roles (beyond Assistants).",0

"Unrealistic goals, poor work-life balance for most employees, poor management accountability, poor internal development in most organizations, do not utilize their own product like they should because of the lack of work-life balance. Leadership was greedy during layoffs. Coursera’s strong financial position with no debt (close to $1B in assets) and executives with 8-figure salaries (plus bonus) were given a substantial amount of RSU’s without vesting cliffs granted in Oct and received in Nov shortly after the layoff. Other prominent organizations with layoffs considered the impact to those laid-off and accelerated the grants and waived vesting cliffs. For a B corp company which prides itself on doing the right thing and investing in its people, senior leadership quickly forgot that philosophy when it came to receiving RSUs. Great WSJ article on how Coursera handled their layoffs.",0

The job is not stressful or difficult by any means, and provides a great opportunity to grow during the slower winter months where you can do other work during your downtime.

"India leadership is not supportive at all.
Before accepting the offer ask these questions from the Sales Head:
1. How many sellers stay in Coursera even after 1 year? 
You may be surprised to learn that most of them leave within 4-6 quarters because they realise that that territory they have has been allocated does not allow them to even come close to quota
2. How many sellers met the quota last year? Why did they not meet quota? All were poor??
3. Sales leadership is disinterested in career development and keeps hiring and firing sellers",0
"There has been an increasing, egregious lack of consideration for employees. This ongoing deterioration has only accelerated and intensified under new corporate direction. In spite of diversionary tactics such as empathy trainings and wholesome, long-term goals for Kiehl's, corporate actions toward employees have demonstrated the antithesis of such values and practices. Instead of being forthcoming and transparent, corporate has kept employees in the dark about their futures in the company; instead of honesty, we have gotten euphemisms - ""service-focused scheduling models"" and unmentionable inanities about selling techniques, composed with the inclusion of emojis. Such flimsily yet thickly veiled proceedings are not positive for anyone involved, and to dress them up in any other way is disingenuous, insulting, and in bad faith. We deserve respect. A company that is solely profit-driven with little regard for the livelihoods of its employees is one of which I cannot be a part. What is happening now will only foster an adversarial relationship between a company and its employees; both will suffer.",0

"Compared to big corporate environment I came from, smaller company/startup stands out in terms of people, collaboration, and mission-driven culture. Indiegogo is my first startup experience, and it's been overall a very positive experience.

With big open office space, people get to know each other easily. I'm happy to say that I've made many great friends at Indiegogo, something that corporate environment does not provide. People are generally driven, friendly, motivated, and down to earth.

The company is not too big yet to prevent motivated employees from voicing interests in different projects and engaging in cross-departmental collaboration, despite the fact that the flexibility also provides uncertainty due to the lack of systematic ways to address such employee interests, or facilitate opportunities or transfers of trying new projects.",1
really calm and friendly environment,1
"Bad management, high turn over rate",0
No cons to be honest. Some changes are obvious when a company grows at such fast pace.  Some employees cannot accept the change and hence the criticism.,0
Hourly rate-very low. Renumeration package- very basic. Constant administration to attend to on top of customer service in store regarding: store operations/duties/Reading material /product modules/submission of documents/stock handling/daily emails etc -leaving little focus to serve customers . Head office departments are very unhelpful when you require support and don't communicate with each other well enough to offer direction/answers required. Human resources uninterested in sales consultants when use store space for rare meetings. Lacking in diversity particularly with management.,0

"Recent hires haven been extremely disappointing. Managerial positions last less than 2 years at a minimum which resulted in frequent changes of business structures (localised) to staff all the time, reducing productivity. They usually lack a deeper understanding of the operational requirements in the company and hence micro manage every task in just a short few months of their attachment. Managers lack power in this aspect, making their roles seemingly redundant and small issues that can be resolved were escalated unnecessarily. Global head office visits have changed; they (not all!) no longer stay humble and interact with floor staff and instead, select few were always seen giving side eyes as if we mean nothing in the company or do self-visits with their personal friends that seemingly conduct interrogative questioning.

The same goes for the retail level. Work attitudes were less than expected that prompts further internalized team conflicts over petty matters. Consultants that are applying should be reviewed much more stringently and take into consideration their daily work practices as some of them can be derogatory even in the presence of customers.

Departments always seem to lack budget for hiring new staff that will clearly help improve productivity but of course, profits first. Then planet. (Sorry, what people?)",0

"We're a lean and mean crew, which means we're not for everyone. There is a lot of work to be done and it's not all prescriptive. It requires a bit of an entrepreneurial spirit to thrive in this type of 'scriptless' environment. 
Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the business means that priorities shift, and it's important to understand how your day-to-day is aligned to the overarching vision. For folks who like to predictability and a more static set of priorities QoQ/YoY, this might be too fast-paced.",0

Dishonesty. No transparency. There is NO team. The store manager and assistant manager only look out for themselves and their positions which they are both unqualified for anyway. You're on your own. Don't expect any support from anyone in upper management as you will not get it even if you are in every way in the right. They will only look out for the management duo that they put in place. Everyone else is there to fill in the gaps. You will be used. There is blatant favoritism.,0
None that come to mind.,0
"Not much if you do your job, it pays off.",0
"The company, upon growing, has become very successful. However there is a lack of consideration or slight hypocrisy of its own ethos and values of patience and playing the slowgame. Some of the management are overly number driven and have tendency to micromanage. 

There is also a large disconnect between the retail staff and their head office staff. Not a lot of respect is shown back to the teams in store (especially during covid) which makes walking into the head office feel like waking into the teachers lounge at school.

There also isn't much opportunity to move up within the company based on ability alone. It's often who you are overly friendly with, which in a bit of a white washed (from top down) company, isn't always the most comfortable to dive straight into.",0

"Communication can be really bad between higher ups and people in-store. I worked for the store for over 2 years and saw 3 different coworkers successfully transfer to other markets with under 1 year of experience. When I requested a transfer I gave a month notice and was told by my manager in my last few meeting that my KPIs were looking good. Seeing that the success rate for transfers that I had seen so far was 100% I had high hopes. I also saw several different postings for the job I wanted to transfer with on several different platforms. In the end I didn’t hear from anyone. After waiting a week after I had moved I reached out to my manager and was told to reapply as an external. That makes no sense if management did their job and submitted my request to transfer. I would have preferred a clear rejection rather than just being ghosted. The most frustrating thing was that I passed up an opportunity at another job a few months before my transfer because I felt loyal to the company. This job would have paid more too. If only I had known my 2 years of commitment to the company would be worth nothing when it came down it I wouldn’t have been put in such a difficult situation. 
In terms of pay it feels random. I started at $16 several other workers began at $17 or $18 and sometimes it didnt seem dependent on experience or merit. One employee hired at $18 was so bad at the job they were fired at their 90 day review. I know in a company you’re not supposed to discuss pay, but people talk and they should realize that. 
Scheduling is a MESS. It seems that none of the store managers are trained in scheduling because I just don’t see how it can be so hard to coordinate 5 people’s schedules when they have fixed days available. If you have an open schedule I’d advise against telling them that. Give yourself at least a solid 2 days that you’re unavailable or you’ll find yourself working 6-10 days (sometimes more) in a row. Being paid overtime is great but your mental health is also really important. It’s also just the cherry on top of the cake when your store manager complains to you about being absolutely exhausted after working 6 days and needing a longer weekend. I think it’s important for managers to realize that working 5-6 days in a row from 9-5 each day is vastly different from working 6-10 days on a random schedule where you have a several “clopens” and no consistency. Just be aware that this was an issue with ALL of the managers.",0

"Store managers get away with a gross amount of bullying of consultants and not doing their jobs. If you choose to report your concerns or mention the harassment to your regional manager you will simply be brushed off due to the cliques and friendship groups between the management teams. I have worked in several locations and have seen long-standing, hard working consultants be pushed to the point of bursting into tears on the shop floor because of the behaviour of managers. The brand tries to push the concept of being ""intellectually stimulating"" and ""mindful"" in all aspects of functioning but it's all just  surface acting. Due to the prolific understaffing you will very often be left on your own or with only one other person to help during extremely busy periods (resulting in agressive customers) whilst the managers will sit in the backroom texting on their phone or just straight up go out for an hour long coffee with their friends during a shift (whilst obviously not on their break).

"Two co-CEOs with too much ego to realize neither is qualified to run a company leads to the worst leadership team ever.  The situation is so bad, in fact, that their investor (KPCB) forced on them another executive - so now they have two CEOs and a President.  The culture is so bad that other than the original students (at Stanford) under Daphne and Andrew (in the CS department), most early employees leave as soon as they hit their one year vesting cliff.  Since so many employees leave in disgust, the leadership has begun request they sign a Non-Disparagement Agreement.  

Although the company built its reputation on a veneer of social impact and the motto of ""Do what's best for the student,"" they've done nothing to back it up and lacks any clear mission statement.  Leadership has been brought in from YouTube and NetFlix, and even at 50+ people, there are only three educators on staff.  Although classes remain free, no effort has been spent to improve - or even measure - student learning or outcomes, and Coursera ignores even the most basic fact of education - that students do not learn by watching videos and regurgitating facts.  Then again, with a completion rate below 5% for most classes, it's not clear people even succeed in watching the videos.",0
"I was recruited through a temping agency in SF, and the original description was easily fulfilled. I went into the job as if it were a temp job (I was mentally prepared for that) but the HR and management led me to believe that it would be a month or longer job. (I thought to myself, oh, this is great, there are great people here and it's a pretty cool job! Why not stay there?) 

Alas, two weeks into it (after putting in MANY hours over 40 per week, I might add) I got a call from my temp agent, telling me that IGG had found an ""internal"" solution to filling the role. That's fine, but... it was a Friday, and I had just left the office and was on my way home. And the HR manager/upper level management/whomever could have let me know beforehand so that I could at least bring my personal belongings back home with me. (Because of policies at the temping agency, once a role has been ""finished"" by the books the temp worker is not allowed back at the place of work.) I was shocked and upset at this news because I had felt like I was being inducted into the company and felt relatively secure in the position (for the ascribed amount of time, at least!) 

My complaint is that the HR management structure is terribly unprofessional and communication is barely present. It was offensive to hear the news from my temp agent and not from my boss at IGG. It was an awful experience, based solely on the unprofessional handling of my exit from the company.",0

Throughout my multi-year tenure at TOMS I've met at least a hundred people who I would classify as either exceedingly brilliant, genuine, kind, approachable, or any combination of these traits. I've been fortunate to be surrounded by such talent and even call a few of my peers as friends. These are the ones who, like me, were drawn to TOMS because of how disruptive and progressive its business model was in retail; that in of itself makes it incredibly easy to connect with so many people at TOMS across various levels of the org structure and disciplines. Most everyone came to TOMS because they wanted to work for a company that stood for something other than just hitting sales targets, or being featured in fancy publications; inherently, you're going to meet a bunch of folks at TOMS that share a common interest in making a positive impact on the world. And I can't think of a better way to bring working professionals together...

Which leads to the next major plus of TOMS - the mission. Yes, it's real. And if you've never worked here but have read the articles online criticizing TOMS - the authors can go pound sand. Are there better ways to help communities than giving free shoes to those in need? Sure. Should we do something other than subsidize optical surgeries to improve the eyesight for the less fortunate that have limited or no vision? Maybe. But I can tell you the aid that TOMS provides is a hell of a lot better than being an armchair critic trying to tell a company how to run the philanthropic side of its operations. The famous Giving Trips are there to provide employees the experience of what our amazing partners tirelessly do day in, day out. These partners are the real heroes - they're the ones working out in the field in less than ideal conditions to improve the lives of others unselfishly. Do they need TOMS? Definitely not. But whenever our Giving team receives a thank you letter from the founders, presidents, etc. of these organizations expressing their gratitude of TOMS' commitment and partnership you can't help but feel proud that you work for the company that pioneered integrating philanthropy alongside a sustainable business. When you're on a Giving Trip and slip shoes on the feet of a kid that stares at their new pair of shoes in awe, looks up at you and smiles, then hugs you in the purest form of appreciation - nothing else matters, not even an online article trivializing the good that we do at TOMS.

I guess the last positive are the random, less-important perks - coffee bar, dogs in the office, laid-back environment, neat office space.",1

There is some room for advancement and promotions across departments, but at a certain point you will hit a wall unless you have a very specialized skill, and over the years those higher positions have started going more to outside hires than from internal promotion.

"Basically it is depressing to see the higher authorities and department mainly using ""mouth power"" for instructions to have their jobs done. And all this were weighted on the shoulder at all staffs in the retail space.  Most of the time, the instructions wasn't clear and expected that we have to knew it all and carried out the instructions perfectly. They hardly came to the stores to assist in preparation , and all things were done by the retail staffs and the office department team only come down to point fingers what were not done correctly.

Often when there were some situations we faced at retail floor, which needed advice from the higher authorities for solutions, it was mostly threw back to us for look for a solution ourselves. The teamwork in the office is so bad that I realized most are simply lazy and like to push tasks to others which ended to the retail staffs at the end.  And  helps and solutions are needed from certain department urgently, we always  saw a very slow response which took days or even week or no response at all. This is really bad.

The commission scheme is the most worrying part as we all knew the truth the consultants worked really hard to meet the store budget in order to get their incentive. In our case, the target given to stores were hardly fair.  Busier store were given high sky rocking budget, which can be 20-30% more as compared to light year. Incentive is only given if we meet 100% at store target, and nothing were given if we were only a few  thousands behind. But looking at the overall achievement , in actual fact we did a 15-18% growth as prepare to light year. The consultants always felt robbed and it bring down the morale of individuals.  Please understand the retail staffs are the one who bring in the business and with so most work loads to shoulder and end of the day not rewarded, most will probably decide to leave the environment to seek for a greener paths. It definitely not easy for consultants in retail spaces as they have so much to deal and absorb which a very strict require working environment.

There are so much more to say but i personally think these are the situations we are facing, especially situated one of the most challenging region in south east asia, where prices on products are even much more higher than most regions.",0

"TOMS really gives to the children, and goes above and beyond with giving. Our happy hours often include some sort of donation either by us building care packages or bicycles for local people in need. It is a benefit of TOMS not being a non-profit. Reporting is not regulated and money invested in giving isn’t tied to specific government requirements. There is a program to also donate some time to help local charities, however many teams are unable to do this due to business requirements.

As an employee you are entitled to 2 free pairs of shoes per season. This helps both promote the brand, and allows the employees to be more involved with the products that they support. Benefits are average for related companies (based on recent offers from other companies). 

The people that I get to work WITH (see CONS) on a daily basis are some of the brightest, most creative people I have ever had the opportunity to work with. My team and the teams that I often interact with are some of the hardest working, most dedicated people I have the pleasure of knowing.

The new CEO Jim Alling appears as if he wants to fix the issues that plague TOMS but he is seemingly taking direction from some of the people that are large contributors to the issues. I whole-heartedly believe that Jim will fix some of what is wrong eventually.

"The good people I met at Coursera joined to make a difference in the world. They, like me, wanted to provide affordable, high quality education at scale. Degrees from universities were not designed to be affordable or even a useful credential in the market. Chose the wrong degree, the wrong university or some combination of the two and you're stuck with a worthless degree and a ton of student loans.

Coursera started off disrupting the university degree system, but, under the reign of the CEO Rick and now Jeff, Coursera embraces the very system it was designed to disrupt. Why? Because of the MONEY. Coursera can offer 5x or more university expensive degrees than a university could. For example, under the original co-founders Daphne and Andrew, Coursera launched was University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC)'s Masters of Data Science, a top 5 ranked Computer Science degree program, priced at very affordably $20,000. Coursera is now pressuring UIUC to increase the price of their degree program, so that Coursera could increase its profit margins.

If you love the mission of education, Coursera is not a good fit for you, because it tricks learners out of their hard earned money and flood the market with lower quality degrees (Remember 
University of Phoenix?). If you don't care about the mission and just want to make money, Coursera is not a good fit for you either. Don't think for a second any of that money Coursera is pocketing will end up your bank account. Coursera has a terrible leveling system designed to keep you in the lowest possible level and lowest pay. Working harder will NOT get you promoted, but your manager is happy to lie to you that it will.

Every company has problems, but having worked in over a dozen big and small companies, Coursera is by far in the worse shape. The problems are so systemic, there will need to be a massive overhaul in leadership and management at all levels. I am planning my exit and so are most individual contributors. Heed my warning. Coursera survives by suckering good people into working for the company. You will either be brainwashed into a soulless minion or leave disgusted with the company you once loved.",0

"Since edX was acquired by 2U, there has been changes and now all of them are good: we lost our offices which also affected on our work and connections. I haven't met most of my colleagues in person and probably I'll never meet them. Before 2020, edX allowed some employees to travel to other offices at the company's expense, but that stopped since we're all remote and lost our offices. The excuse is that 'there is no business need', said by those that still travel and meet people in person. I understand edX goals and mission after all these years, but I honestly don't know much about 2U... and it's been two years since the acquisition. I feel they don't really care about edX and probably the other way around too. I tried to meet some 2U employees, I was successful at meeting a few... but it was impossible to meet others, and I tried, but the interest needs to work on both ways. There are few opportunities to grow, we just get to work on side projects and tasks. I think most of us stay here because of other benefits: decent salary, flexibility, good environment overall and so on. I honestly see myself staying here for more years as long as we keep those benefits, even if I never get to meet any of my colleagues in person and I remain stuck in the same position with just some new tasks and projects every now and then. With the acquisition and changes, I fear edX will become more strict and maybe we'll lose some of our benefits or flexibility... I'll definitely consider leaving then, with sadness, and probably will look for a job in a company that has an office but allows to wfh half of the time.",0

It feels like a place highly paid individuals go to coast and do the bare minimum, meanwhile people on the floor are busting their butts every day for $18/hr.",0

This translates to the company culture, too.

"Culture of fear permeates every corner of the business - people are sacked for no reason and with no notice.

Gaslighting, manipulation and bullying are rife and come from the very top.

Micro management by the owners starves the business and its talent of creative oxygen.

Base pay and employment terms and conditions are pitiful and not competitive. This is covered up with staff benefits that get good PR (puppy leave, free beer, discount in bars etc.)

There is no structure to pay progression and most of the time you are told there is a pay and recruitment freeze however you watch as they burn money on vanity projects (e.g. tv network, airline, damaging marketing campaigns).

There is no professional development. Performance reviews, objectives, targets, employee check ups are hit or miss depending on what department you are in. This is not a place to build a career.  

Don't dare speak up, raise legitimate issues, act professionally or try to use data and facts to solve problems - this is a one way ticket to your P45.

Turnover of staff is wild but in particular at a senior level.  I had 6 line managers in 2 years. This means you are permanently having to prove yourself to a new manager, never getting consistent leadership and changing your work priorities to suit the next new manager's agenda.

People who say it is a fast paced environment must be mediocre at their work. It is so slow and full of bureaucracy it's painful.  It takes months to get invoices paid or anything approved.",0

"What a disappointment. For a company that touts the importance of mental health, wellness, and giving back to the community, it’s unfortunate that they don’t lead their teams with the same focus and compassion. 
Depending on the team you are on, you were likely hired as a remote employee, but TOMS is now requiring remote employees to come onsite weekly, monthly, or quarterly at the employee’s expense. This rule and mandate applies to all levels of employees. In other words, entry level or middle management employees are paying $300+ a night on hotels and hundreds of dollars on gas / plane tickets, etc to comply. Executive leadership might be able to afford this, but most employees can’t. 
This burden adds undue stress financially and mentally. Meaning, employees are fearful of losing their jobs if the don’t take on the financial burden. This is also reinforced by a bully / intimidation leadership approach that exists within some teams. Employees are afraid to speak up to leaders, as they will be in their line of fire in a private or public forum.",0
"Pay scale is terrible compared to responsibilities and the salaries aren’t competitive. I was making more than the AM easily whilst being below them. Whilst that may seem arrogant or maybe a good thing to me, it shows how bad the pay scale is. 

You can read other reviews that show how mistreated the head office staff are. Unfortunately that does trickle over to the bar team where they have to deal the terrible marketing ploys, misinformation and passive aggressive behaviour. 

The bars are vastly behind other craft beer bars in the local areas but refuse to try and create a local niche and instead adhere to the cookie cutter style.

"- Pure corporate greed. Their profit margins were suffering, so they laid off over 100 of the district and regional managers last year and just did another massive layoff internally for the managers/supervisors in stores. They have cut the headcount, labor hours, and pay rates down to the bare minimum, leaving skeleton crews, but ramping up the job requirements and expectations. “Squeezing blood from a turnip”, so to speak. 
- They also hired FAR less qualified people in management after the layoff because they’re “cheaper labor”, and trust me.. You feel it. The environment has become toxic and no one is competent in their jobs in the higher up positions, so the work falls on the shoulders of those beneath them. 
- Again, as an attempt for the company to save as much money as possible, they have cut nearly every incentive the employees used to be able to earn based on performance. Yet, they now have a constant rotation of promos available for the customers. They want more and more from their workers while they continue to strip what little they offered in return.
- Vans used to be about “The Van Doren Way”. Putting their people first. Employees and customers included. Now that they’ve been absorbed by VF Corporation, it’s just another parasitic company feeding off their hosts.",0

"Unfortunately, ever since L’Oreal acquired Kiehl’s in the year 2000, the quality of products and core values of this company have steadily gone downhill. In 2017, the company cleaned house and got rid of their longtime, loyal employees. Kiehl’s brought in a new president (Megan Grant) who was given the directive to “stop the bleeding.” She is ruthless! 

Although Megan Grant gives lip service to “sympathy” and empathy training, the work environment under her leadership is toxic and hostile. Employee morale is the pits. There is a revolving door of turnover in the home office and fleet-wide attrition rates are through the roof in all of their brick-and-mortar stores. 

The cutthroat sales environment and lack of a fair bonus structure in freestanding Kiehl's stores creates malcontent and mental health risks.

Notably, the current president of Kiehl’s was transferred from Body Shop, where she sucked the heart and soul out of their corporate culture, too. In a well-publicized fiasco, L’Oreal was forced to sell Body Shop due to low sales and a controversy surrounding animal testing.

Not only is Kiehl’s heartless when it comes to how they treat their employees, they are NOT cruelty-free when it comes to testing on animals. In order to sell Kiehl's products in China, Kiehl’s Since 1851 continues to test many of their products on animals.",0

"There is not a star low enough that I can give to this company. It is by far the worst Retail Job one could have. The sheer disregard for the well-fair of sales associates is astounding. Sales associates being expected to take on a lot of management responsibilities without being fairly compensated. There is also seemingly an East Asian Hiring Racist Fetish to uphold an illusion of sorts that all East Asians could be taken as Japanese. The importance placed on frequent , irrelevant Head office visits takes away from sales associates being able to conduct themselves correctly as fear is placed on them. The business structure functions like that of a startup with rules being made up by managers on the spot to assert negative dominance. The incentives for staff sales are abysmal to say the least with targets being so high. Furthermore, the company culture is so toxic that of course it’s unsurprising that this year alone there was over a 70% staff turnover in the retail stores. It’s a disgraceful cult place to work. If you have any sense DO NOT APPLY TO WORK HERE.",0

(it,s not the 1950's) and you aren' allowed to say a staff member has left-they have ""spread their wings""...honestly!! If you are in the little favourites group, you will get on quickly, so now a culture of young new managers who say all the right things (as dictated too by the company) progress, leaving the real talent behind, hence the massive increase in staff turnover. Such a shame that this company is heading back to a pre-LOreal time where it nearly went down due to bad management and telling itself how unique it was.",0

"So if you've read through all the pros, you must be think to yourself, ""Wow, how can this person only give 2 stars? Are the downsides really that bad?"" That's for you to decide.

People - I know I just sang praises about all the amazing colleagues, and while that's true, there's also a fair share of either incompetent, apathetic, ""I'm here to collect a paycheck,"" or any combination of these horrible characteristics that dilutes those that are trying to improve TOMS. Sure, I get there will always be entry to mid-level peeps that just don't care or know about contributing to the company to realize its full potential. But when you have this kind of riff-raff in the upper ranks like VPs and execs...set sail for fail. That's not to say there aren't any good leaders in management - of course there are. But all it takes are a few bad apples in key positions, making hasty or bad decisions because they don't know what's actually going on at the ground level and with a company of our relatively small size it's pretty easy to get up to speed on the details. The fact that these apathetic/incompetent leaders don't know who to tap into at TOMS to get the accurate data or info - that's a reflection of how out of touch they are with their teams or the goals of the company. Some of these ""coasters"" have since been ousted, but rest assured a good amount remain in the upper ranks.

Onto a related topic...the current state of the company. I don't know what I'm allowed to disclose, so I'll play it safe and keep it general - we've made several bad decisions in the past few years since the brand exploded; decisions that have wasted unfathomable amounts of resources - time, money, and effort. Decisions that have cost the company and are still haunting us to this day. Decisions that have forced the entire organization to lose focus and always be in constant state of chaos. Decisions that have led to missed opportunities to continue growing the brand. Just...bad decisions. And the worst thing? Besides the fact that it's self-inflicted, it is never ending - there's a difference between fast-paced (recruiter buzzword) and chaotic (reality at TOMS). What I mean by that: most of the major projects we work on - there's little to no planning...want to know what happens when you don't carefully plan out a big, cross-functional project? I'll tell you - missed deadlines and budget constraints, frustration, gaps (""Oh I thought YOU were going to do it""), and in general a lot of finger pointing which ultimately leads to low morale. It's gotten to the point that pretty much all the executors in projects expect them to go sideways or lose steam before we even have the project kick-off, which is sad. Then it's just a vicious cycle because we need to work on the next project and because someone neglected to be accountable and plan out the milestones with realistic targets - again, it flies off the rails. Rinse and repeat. So what this long-winded paragraph boils down to is no accountability at TOMS. I'm all for giving people second chances but if someone is running a project or brokering a deal that if it goes badly, could represent a huge miss in sales or cost us a ton of money - someone needs to be held responsible and take a demotion, be put on a PIP, or something. But no - that's not very ""TOMSy"" so we let these key decision-makers continue to make the same mistakes over and over.

You know what else isn't TOMSy? Staying in your lane and not overlapping, duplicating someone else's efforts, or creating redundancy. The problem is because the TOMS way is to let people come into their own with little to no guidance from a seasoned mentor, there ends up being 5 people trying to achieve the same result and doing it in 5 different ways without even knowing there were other people working on the exact same thing. And then letting people do important tasks that need to be reviewed/monitored because they have little experience in this area - I've lost count how many times I've seen poor execution because nobody was communicating or providing mentorship or asking for help. So what other companies call ""exposure to a variety of disciplines"" TOMS just really need to stop offering this and clearly define roles, or figure out how to better allow people to try out new things under supervision to ensure some semblance of quality is delivered. Also, this used to not be as much of a problem as it is now but there are too many cooks in the kitchen i.e. we're still too top heavy as an organizational hierarchy; decisions that should be quickly made so we can adapt take too long, and it creates this weird dynamic where it has to propogate through multiple unnecessary decision-makers and/or people who are basically pass-through (they provide no input or don't make decisions) so it's literally like you are setting up a meeting to tell someone something just so they can relay exactly what you said to someone else. But the person you told will probably misinterpret and there's all these translation issues where you are playing that game with cups connected with a string and when you hear back what the last person thought the first person said - it ends up being completely different!

Then all the other cool, fun things we used to do as a company to maintain our culture and the friendly vibes - happy hours, annual trips...those are all gone. Bonuses are pretty terrible since they're tied to company performance, and merit increases are meager. Yes, these cost money and we're clearly not in the same position we were in 5 years ago but in the interest of disclosure to candidates - aside from the business model, there are no real perks and we're beginning to just feel like another company getting corporatized by private equity swooping in to set us up for a sale event.",0

very challenging time for the company as it has transformed from a non-profit to a hyper-focused for-profit with 2U acquiring edX in 2021-2022 and the acquisition - as most acquisitions go - has been very challenging. mass layoffs and tanking stock price value to an all-time low leaves very little room for needed psychological security as the business pivots. tough times all around.,0

Training used to make people feel that they owe the company their loyalty for very little reward. 

Extra bonuses like the unicorn fund is put forth as an empowering scheme but often is abused and brings out the greedy nature of staff, more often than not the managers.
As a result working for this business becomes nasty very quickly. You'll find that people will sabotage each other to get ahead.

Part of being inclusive is valuing all functions equally. Often functions in companies have a clear hierarchy (e.g. at Google it's engineering über alles).

The things that drew me to Coursera remain consistent: We get to work on one of the most important missions in the world, to transform lives through educational access, with some of the smartest and most caring people I've ever worked with. Since our new CEO Jeff joined, what has changed for the positive has been clarity of our business strategy with a strategy that is driving tremendous business growth with huge future potential and a strong and unified leadership team who is working together to set direction and vision for the company. 

Ultimately I come to work everyday because I believe we are building a path so that anyone, anywhere, no matter where they start can build a path to wherever they want to go and whoever they want to be which is incredibly powerful. We see learners first hand all the time for whom this is reality and this inspires me and excites me about all that is in our future. 

We also get to do it with a team who is incredibly committed, collaborative, and talented which creates a much better culture and environment than I've ever been part of in my professional career.

"Very lengthy recruitment process for a retail position. 

Head office, and most other stores are a bit too pretentious. It's odd how they care so much about the language you use and clothing you wear as they stress the importance of ""natural, organic interactions"" but when everything is sort of scripted it becomes the opposite??

Could do better in regards to sustainability, ethical supply chain and accessibility (e.g. Paddington store in Sydney has a step making it difficult for customers in wheelchairs to enter the space).

Not really a con, but I think that Aesop's overall air of pretension can be a bit off-putting to customers who seem almost afraid to come into the store sometimes.",0

"I've been at Coursera over a year and can honestly say, hands down, this is the best place I have ever worked. The opportunities are growth are endless, as long as you're willing to push for them. You really need to proactive and hustle to succeed here, but it's worth it. Looking back, I'm proud of how much I've grown since I've been at Coursera. I don't think that would be the case at a larger company.

Other pros:
- Smart, dedicated colleagues who genuinely care about people and education
- Ownership. This is huge. I've always felt my managers went above and beyond to make sure I felt ownership of my work and recognized my impact. 
- Flexible work hours & work from home Wednesdays 
- Unlimited vacation people actually take regularly (huge thumbs up to this)
- Lunch, dinner, snacks. Healthcare. The usual valley perks. 
- ***There is a huge ability to make an impact, not only at a personal growth level, not only at a company level, and most importantly, at a global level. I can't think of any other company that has the opportunity to do good for others like Coursera.***",1

"The leadership is absolutely awful.  I've never seen such a poorly run company.  The whole place is complete and utter chaos.  Managers seem incapable of making even the most basic of decisions and have no idea how to manage people and engage their teams and make them feel valued. 
Basic processes are not in place because it's not ""cool"".
Don't even think about career development because it's non existent.  They would much rather hire someone external than develop the people that are there already.
The People team are a total waste of space, they would much rather paint unicorns than help you if you've got an issue.  I also found them to be the most unapproachable team in the whole company and tried to avoid any contact with them.
The safety culture in the business is disgusting.  There is PPE available yet some people choose not to use it putting themselves and others at risk, management do not seem to want to do anything about fixing this.
Overall, the culture is the worst I have ever seen.  People are overstretched, overworked and undervalued.",0

No business is perfect and as we are still pretty young and growing at an insane speed, it's easy to run into unexpected problems. However, the people team are ace and constantly listening to feedback from teams. They have implemented many new benefits in the last 12 months, including free private healthcare, an unbelievable enhanced pension contribution, and equal end of year bonus for ALL employees. 

They have also recently launched a world-class staff and management training scheme that goes hand in hand with a learning and development fund for each employee. There are also great progression opportunities across the board; packaging teams are put through their apprenticeships, and there is a great bar management development programme too. Lots of people have moved up through the ranks from junior positions and have been given chances unheard of in other companies.",1

- Fun work environment - Big on company culture - No hardcore dress code - Flexible hours,1
"Lack of clear performance management and people development practices. There are plenty of opportunities for this, but it will vary based off who your manager is.

"They have a very negative outlook about the sales staff; in short, if you're not a butt-kissing, back-biting, yes man, your contributions to the overall success of the store is minimized to the fullest extent and you're just thought of as ""Another sales person and their a dime a dozen"".  This is the mind set even if your sales numbers are considered impressive. If you have retail experience my advice is ""Don't WASTE YOUR TIME or Your Self Esteem"" with these guys.",0

"Way too many chains of management both within bars and above retail level
Rather stagnant progression with little communication on actually achieving personal growth within the business
Pay well below what the industry standard is now becoming
Training is non-existent after the first week. Seen it now personally and done to other staff members during my time in the business. Staff just left to work it out and left to just rot pretty much. Fosters an awful culture and makes it unpleasant to work in and continues to drive people out the business.",0
The management does not understand how to develop the business. The management does not take the time to understand the territories and the territory needs.,0
Good benefits and flexible time schedule,1
"Kiehl's knows how important it is to get instantly connected with your team since internships are very quick, so they introduce you to everyone during your first week. This helped me build relationships with everyone very quickly allowing me to do my job better. My tasks were all incredibly relevant and helped me grow. It was also real work with a real team. I never felt like I was just doing busy work. Also, there is a final project that you present to the company president, senior administration, and HR. It's a wonderful opportunity to show how hard you have been working.",1
At least my location didn’t give you free ice cream which was kind of annoying. Super busy and understaffed on weekends can be very tense. Not paid minimum wage (tips supposedly make up for it),0

"VF has changed Vans. Massive layoff has/is happening, store closures probably will be happening too. If you don't have a dedicated store manager the team will be sour. Management makes working there worth it! Merit raises are normally under a dollar. Vans hasn't been profitable in two years and they blame the retail employees for it... but it's not their faults. Very hard to move up in the company because people don't want to leave. Even harder if you want to be a DM or move into corporate. Vans says they are a people company but they are not anymore, and hasn't been since 2020. I was laid off with no notice. Lots of turn over now and associates call off all the time.",0

"My mission here is not to write a full review, just to correct some statements in earlier reviews that are incorrect or out of date.

Indiegogo has good market share already but still needs to establish itself as a sustainable business. We made good progress in 2015 on identifying and serving our entrepreneur market (e.g. InDemand) and you'll see more of that in 2016. Our social mission is still alive and well, it's just not so mixed in with the rest of the business.

'Work-life balance' is about as good as one could expect from a company at this stage. Four weeks of vacation is standard. New parents get two months of leave, and leaders set an example by taking it. There are also standard holidays plus your birthday, and early closures on the days before holidays.

Regarding diversity, six of the 15 members of the coordination team (the company's highest-level decision-making group) are women, to say nothing of one of the three founders (all of whom are still with the company). Overall Indiegogo is relatively diverse for an Internet company. Engineering has fallen behind lately, although there is energy behind getting back on track there.

Finally, some employees may have been asked to write Glassdoor reviews shortly after joining, but I wasn't, and if it's a broad policy I'm not aware of it.

As other reviews have mentioned, the people are generally excellent and very positive (by far the biggest reason to work here for most of us here), the office and related services are pretty good, and dogs are welcome!",1

"TOMS is still very much a startup while being a mid size company. Both of those have very different implications. In one way we are still nimble and able to move quickly where needed. But, thanks to Bain and new leadership we have a lot of processes being added that are creating a much more efficient and effective business.

If you enjoy a challenge and want to learn to grow as a professional, this is a great place with opportunities to do that if you are willing to put in the effort on your own. If you want an easy job where you can sit back, collect a paycheck, and have an inflated title this is not the place for you.

TOMS is 100% giving One for One with all of our products which is our commitment to all. And, there are so many ways we are improving lives beyond that, through our employment opportunities, friendly work environment and perks, last mile budget (which makes sure we are not a financial burden to our giving partners), local manufacturing, and so many other ways that you can only fully experience by working here.

Our leadership team is 95% full and stronger than any leadership team we have had in the past. And, our employees are committed to our mission and want to make the world a better place. 

I have had ups and downs here, but it has and continues to be a wonderful ride that I am incredibly grateful for. I have never been more excited than I am right now for where TOMS is headed.",1

2. Employees are grossly underpaid. Despite Sierra Nevada's tremendous success over the past 2 decades, employees continue struggling to pay their bills. This is true for both warehouse and professional-level staff. I know of at least 10 employees with bachelor's degrees whom must work multiple jobs to keep the lights on at their homes. In conducting a compensation analysis, it is clear that Sierra Nevada is in a lag position for most company occupations relative to virtually every comparable competitor.",0

"I think most of the cons of working at Indiegogo are the result of growing pains. The industry and company is expanding at a rapid rate and we sometimes can't keep up. 

For example, while I really think this is an opportunity, one challenge we face is that a lot of our internal tools haven't been optimized yet. This means that there is a lot of room for improvement which I find exciting, but it is frustrating at times when things break or have to be done manually.

We have had a bad habit of overcommitting and lacking focus. A lot of projects have been started with positive outlooks and overly-ambitious deadlines only to come to a grinding halt when things need to be re-prioritized. Some of these projects never see the light of day again or become obsolete by the time we get around to them. 

Advancement in the organization is unclear for now. I want to hold off on judgement until I have been here longer and have a clearer sense of my own career path, but for now I feel that there isn't a good system in place for people to advance within the company. 

Even though we are experiencing some frustration as we expand, we always look at how we can overcome them and adapt. We are always iterating to better our tools and product; we just implemented a new process of OKRs to focus our team efforts; and our HR department has a track record for listening to employees and providing new improvements when suggested like a 401k. 

I firmly believe all of these cons will be addressed (at least in part) in the next year as we adjust to becoming a larger company.",0

To this day the people I worked alongside are people I am happy to know. Before I worked for TOMS, I had read Blake's book -- The experience I had with his company perpetuated his message on a greater level!",1
Compensation is the only downside,0

Work is kinda monotonous the rest is fine,0
"Due to the global nature, some roles will have to communicate with teams in other countries and, for some reason, the expectation is on the australian staff to fit around the schedules of everybody else, so expect to take very late evening calls

They dictate how you dress and speak. They actually have written guides on the language you are expected to use in conversation and in email, and what you should wear. The language code is honestly extremely alienating and inappropriate as you are expected to speak like a middle-upper class, middle aged white woman, and this of course is extremely difficult for non-natives to adapt to.  Even the dress code is unfair - you are expected to wear certain materials and they offer some discounts with local brands, however even with the discounts the clothing is too expensive. To be blunt, all these things are modeled from one of the founders - an aging lady who clearly lives an extremely priveleged life and, as interesting as she is, is sightly snobby and judgemental in a way that she disapproves of peoples speech patterns, ineterests and clothing. They take her personality adn inject this into the business, and you'll see this if you visit a store and pay attention to the way the staff interact wit you. The entire thing is scripted - and very clever and natural feeling script - but a script nonetheless. For a company that claims to value culture and diversity, I find it shocking at just how up itself it is in the whitest, most privileged sense. Not to mention the fact that everyone will wear clothing from other cultures, but will be the first extreme socialist liberals to scream 'cultural appropriation'. 

On the same topic of etiquette and codes - theese actually breed an extremely passive aggressive behaviour on occasion. Where you are expected to use certain polite statements in all your email - the receptionists  and other staff will send extremely passive aggressive emails using eloquent and flowery language. It's grating and the expectation to pad your emails honestly becomes hampering over time, especially when you simply need to get things done. 

They are also painfully indecisive, especially regarding interviews. my manager had 9 interviews before they hired them, and they wanted to do 10 but he declined. Most people go through at least 3-4 interviews and you'll meet 2-3 people in each interview. They also like to promote internally and unfortnately, the balance is in the wrong dorection because they do not train people - only promote them, so you end up with senior people not having a clue how to do things, and have grown within the Aesop bubble so they lack outside ideas and perspectives.

They make a huge profit but don't invest it enough in benefits and training.

The CEO is not based in melbourne. He moved to the UK. Yet Melbourne are the head offices. This means senior staff in core functions have a lack of direction. it also means the CFO is acting as de facto CEO and he isn't a nice person, nor is he well liked. Other senior leaders are also vying for the CEO spot, such as senior leaders who sit next to the CEO in London, and others around the global business. 

Peole act like children sometimes and leadership lack a firm hand to put these things in line. In fact, sometimes it's the leaders themselves having petty squabbles or just generally throwing childish tantrums. It comes from a place of passion, but really it's quite pathetic.",0

If you disagree with management, even respectfully, you'll be iced out. If they don't fire you, they know what to do to make you want to quit.

They have shockingly little awareness of their real issues: fraud, consumer trust, and an external comms department operating like it's two decades ago and you can just deny deny deny. There's also little tolerance for anyone thinking critically about these issues or trying to address them in a constructive, proactive manner.

Recent rumors of union busting are gross but not out of character.

If you want to work for a company that has a cohesive, actionable vision for its future, this ain't it.",0

the people they hire are generally very nice (with rare exceptions) so the working environment is pretty decent. There aren't many rude or unreasonable customers too. Great employee discount too,1
"- No work/life balance - except some emails/meetings/calls/slacks in the evening and even during the weekends. Employees are giving everything, but even as a top performer, you get very little recognition.
- Some sales techniques are completely outdated and the micromanagement via metrics is insane. EVERYTHING you do is recorded the second you’re logged in. You’re expected to to volume regardless of the results. 
- Pay is good, but keep in mind that you easily do the job of 3 people at time.
- No room for career progression. Promotions are rare. I would say you need to be in the top 10% continuously for a year to get a chance to get a raise. Moving department is nearly impossible.
- Territories are never discussed with you: it is either you take it or leave the company. Some territories are great, others are very difficult to work with or green, so having roughly the same quota in the team makes it very unfair for some reps. You’re basically lucky or you’re not. You’re being assigned to good and collaborative AEs or you’re not.
- Huge turnover - lots of people get sick or burned out. I stayed a year and almost everyone left in the EMEA sales team (I am talking about at least 20 departures between SDRs and AEs). Besides a few, the ones left are looking elsewhere or stay because they have no choice. Staff retention is not a thing at Coursera.",0

I was the middle man between the product  and activism parts of the business. They were constantly fighting over the brand messaging (product vs. social impact), which led to a very toxic culture. It got to the point where the teams decided to work out of different offices. Forget about team drinks or something similar!

We were often told it was a privilege to work at BrewDog and so should be expected to make some sacrifices to do so. There were so many people who wanted to work there and because of this were taken advantage of.

Communication from management is dreadful. Knowledge is power and so often withheld.

"To preface: I don't think these are actually cons, especially when these comments are measured against competitors. It's more to maybe set expectations right about the direction of the brand (and may not even be accurate at the time you're reading this).

Many reviews here feel outmoded- Aesop has been in the midst of a change of tectonic proportions. Smaller (yet significant) traditions of creating a human-to-human retail experience that constitutes a convincing refutation of the pressure-selling and shiny promises of the beauty industry are no longer even mentioned to new hires, disappearing completely with turnover. Campaign messages and targets can feel forced and ironically build up resentment in some consultants when longtime Aesopians only buy from the Hand Care range or ""refuse"" to purchase the Parsley Seed or Perfect Hydrating Cream because they are longtime devotees to Primrose (no points to guessing which are more expensive/fulfill specific KPIs). 

And yet, this Omnichannel-driven shift in company culture is completely natural in the grand scheme of things. Aesop at times feels like it's ""solo-carrying"" the Natura stock based on breakdowns; its growth is undeniable. The global targets for the years to come are ambitious and dependent on entering new markets and converting more to Fragrance and Skin Care. Accomplishing this would mean more in-house research and anticipation for new, exciting sustainable products, but is currently resulting in a halo effect on said products taught into new consultants' hosting habits. Some clients find this unnerving, but new clients would genuinely probably not be able to parse it out of the overall, still pleasant store visit experience. One final gripe on that note however would be pricing, which at times can feel entirely confusing. See above for an elaboration on the price range (my rating: fair), but it's within the ranges that the questions come up. Take the newest fragrance range, Othertopias, three new perfumes a full Benjamin/Borden more than Hwyl for.... reasons (in all seriousness, it's the new techniques and ingredients the Nose used among other reasons, but the explanation stops when clients and consultants ask exactly one more question: why are they all priced the same?). As a consultant, there will be other products that may confuse you in their pricing, but I would advise to relate it back to how they make you personally feel! There are various ways to navigate this, but it's still something that will linger for me personally.

Anyhow, the tl;dr is that the slower, more personal approach to in-store selling through conversation is being supplanted with personalized, multichannel advertisement, meaning emails with products you like/are likely to purchase, social media banners that would make some past employees cringe and reminders about your purchasing history made by consultants during store visits. 

I think these cons are outweighed by the approach to product development, absolutely KILLER copywriting and the insight into art and design that Aesop conveys through specific newsletters, a colourful intranet for employees to share experiences and interests and the care they put into architecture and store elements.",0

There were some amazing talented hard working people in my time who just disappeared and were cast out. The branding of this wholesome happy diverse presentation could not be further from the horror of everyday work.

Absolutely no consideration for the mental wellbeing of staff. You're BrewDog 24/7 or you're nothing, you have no other life. Don't let them know you're struggling because you'll be kissing that promotion goodbye forever.

Management was unprofessional, in terms of communicating schedule. They never honored any days off or preferences as I had a second job to attend. I spoke to several members who were from other branches in the area who were working 60+ hours with no breaks and less than 12 hours rest between them which is illegal.

"- The CEO has a large platform and brand that is positioning the company well, more than I think people realize. If the company improves, this type of visibility will be positive for everyone who works here. While some people feel this is not good, I think it brings a lot of value. I think the CEO works hard to balance this. He is at every all-hands meeting, he has a true open-door policy, and he responds in all our Slack channels...he does more than I have seen other CEOs do. 
- Having a Black CEO has been amazing, as a person of color, I appreciate this deeply.

"One of the most important reasons that I chose to develop myself in the startup environment is to get my hands on different things and acquire different skill sets. Career development and employee growth opportunities are constant struggles at indiegogo - there is no systematic way facilitating programs like inter-company externship, or giving employees, especially the junior folks, the opportunities to try new projects or even new departments.

Company-level goals and strategies are mostly determined behind the doors, and senior management sometimes is not communicative about major policy changes or updates. Some departments get lost in the chaotic prioritization process, and do not get access to enough resources compared to others.

Junior employees have limited opportunity interacting with the management team. There is no mentorship (another important reason I joined a startup for) encouraged as part of the company culture.",0

"This is a company that will have high expectations and work you to the bone and then when you are exhausted, they are so understaffed that you can’t take a sick day. 
Sales consultants have long hours and are required to stand all day, no exceptions. As stores are always understaffed, they expect you to pick up the slack of others and do two jobs. I worked as a full time employee and acted essentially as a stand in manager being paid the same hourly wage as the new people I was required to train and onboard. They gave out raises to anyone, but for people who have been with the company for long and worked hard, they would cap them off at a certain point. They give everyone the same raises (whether you worked hard or not) to make you feel appreciated but at the end of the day the real hard workers aren’t shown anything worth their time. 
New stores are opened way too early, again leaving the consultants to figure everything out and pick up the pieces left behind by head office and contractors. Stores are designed and put together poorly, wasting material and time and it takes months if not literal years (not exaggerating) to get something repaired in a store. 
Although Aesop does stand behind what they tell customers (for now), as the company grows I have seen internal changes that mirror a larger company and actions that head towards problematic territory and further away from the “personal” approach to managing people and selling to people.",0
Honestly can't think of anything.,0

Also some people have been a little rattled by the reorg that happened late 2017, this is kind of expected. I think the reorg was needed if we ever want to be super successful and generate revenue. There are some old timers leaving due to the change, the company felt a bit like a school at times in the past, that I feel like has halted our potential a little, hopefully the recent change will make us more into a successful business.",0

As some others may find how selective the company is with who they hire a con, I would completely disagree. Working with my fellow peers I appreciate the fact that they carefully choose who to hire. Aesop’s values for sustainability is my personal favorite pro of the company. The company feels so small when you are apart of it. I have been introduced to all different people within the company from other retail consultants to head office staff. I feel like an equal when communicating with head office. Like many other stores of course another pro is the discount! It is easy to have your whole bathroom turn into an Aesop store.",1
"Unprofessional management, favoritism, and high expectations. Come on, it's an ice cream shop worked by a couple 16-17 year old kids, take it easy. I got promoted within the first 2 months.

"-Poor leadership and awareness out of the NY office. Team lacks basic skills to motivate and drive a prosperous team. Consistent pushback towards constructive feedback, tendency of retaliating rather than working towards the root of the problem.
-Upper management consistently undermines field managers which leads to lack of trust and turmoil throughout the region.
-Extreme micromanagement takes place in an effort to control others and create a perception of strength, however, it is counterproductive to the overall business needs.
-Inadequate staffing and scheduling across stores which leads to poor morale and ultimate decline in regional support and productivity. 
-High turnover at all levels, unfortunate loss of dedicated leaders.

"To my point above, I do think that managers could do a better job explaining (candidly) to employees that they need to acquire certain skill sets in order to make the move upward or laterally, and then help them create a plan to get there. Managers tend to (in every company I've been at, not just TOMS) defer to HR for ""employee development."" This is not a solution.

TOMS has a Sr. Leadership team that is lacking a strong vision from the very top of the house. That is why there's so much confusion amongst them. This is a team that needs one seasoned, present Executive leader to guide and shepherd this team.",0

They tend to be generous towards their staff with regular 'write-offs'/free products, staff events etc. 
If you're studying/have other commitments, management are very flexible and accomodating to varied schedules (although I'd imagine this could vary from team to team)
In comparison to other retail or customer-service roles this one is pretty easy - they listen to your concerns and try to make your day-to-day life as work as easy as possible.",1

"-KPIs! I couldn't go a day without hearing about KPIs (key performance indicators, a bunch of numbers to do with samples, getting customer emails, units per transaction and value). It went from something that I was genuinely concerned with to something I felt incessantly badgered by. 
-When I signed on to Aesop, I was looking for something interesting and flexible. My manager was not flexible when it came to scheduling, often made it seem like my scheduling needs couldn't be met and on the occasion they were, as if it was some stretch to meet them .
-They will train you to sound like a robot, than become upset at you for sounding like a robot. 
-The holiday season is what your nightmares are made of.
-Horrible understaffing. 
-I believe the largest con for me was how seriously this company takes itself, and how that is transferred onto sales consultants. At the end of the day, all this company does is sell soaps. This is not radical, revolutionary, life-altering or anything. It is a capitalist engine and if you sign on, you are a puppet for this engine. However, you cannot be a puppet, and do so with ease. Your manager won't stop to realize that perhaps you do not want to work in retail forever, they will forget who you are outside of the shop and come to view you as what they want you to be: a salesperson for a silly place.

"professional growth and transparency.

 TOMS has a big problem promoting from within. I think that they have realized that they have/are losing great talent because of it, and they are trying to correct their course. With that said, it may be too late, given the low morale and mass exodus as of late. At this point, employees may still leave after they are promoted because they can tell that this is a retention tactic vs. a demonstration of value.

In addition, there is a real lack of transparency. Leadership has also tried to make steps towards this, but it often comes across as insincere and forced.",0

"They don't know how to be a company of their size. The core players of the business work with each-other in the same way they always have, the same way they did when Indiegogo was a < 20 person company, but they also have a ton of ""big company"" things (like OKRs and tons of departments and teams with different goals). They are way bigger than their ""heart"" operates, and are really big into ""fearlessness"" as a way of trusting people to do what they need to do, but fearlessness can't always solve the issues with gaps in management in some places, and too much management in others. (I mean... are people on the leaves supposed to be able to say we don't need the trunks?). They organize their strategy around KPIs, but typical of most startups, this results in large swaths of the product being essentially abandoned because no department has a KPI that would justify fixing it (Ahem... E-mail notifications). Multiple departments are responsible for overlapping layers of the experience, and those departments are often not marching to the same drum or KPIs. For example, both product and marketing take responsibility for emails but each has different goals and there isn't a cohesive way to incentivize either department to make the experience of unsubscribing from emails better. Both design, marketing and sales create graphic content for different parts of the experience. However, marketing is encouraged to posture Indiegogo based on 3rd party ""voice and tone"" people, meanwhile the design departments internal work on voice and tone is often discordant with marketing's directions. This rift is because the masters of these departments are marching to different drums (led by KPIs that would indirectly engender incompatible execution), but in execution the beats need to fit together and often don't. This means people's ""fearless"" autonomy is often overlapped by others' fearless autonomy. It's a bit too much ritual, ceremony and corporate rhetoric that doesn't really fit into how i think they want to operate. It's hard to be truly fearless at their size.",0

Morale is low. No one trusts leadership, no one trusts Blake, and no one is sold into the long-term vision of the company. When I say ""no one"" I mean the employees that are not in leadership.

People that leave TOMS are slow to be replaced or not replaced at all, so you may find yourself with double or even triple the workload.

The refrain I hear most often goes something along the lines of ""I love my days at TOMS, I just don't see a future here for me."" Mission, no matter how inspiring, can only take you so far. At the end of the day, you need systems to really support employees and grow them, and it's simply not present.",0

"Indiegogo is made up of smart, driven, and clever people working together toward an admirable goal. The culture is transparent and ripe with opportunities to learn and grow. They have some of the best benefits I’ve had with great work/life balance. The leadership team is caring with an awesome open-door policy. They are often in the trenches working with each of the teams sharing knowledge and providing guidance.",1
"For years Kickstarter has had a leadership in some form of crisis or another. When Yancey took over the leadership was mostly Yancey’s friends or people who’d worked closely with him for years. Then he hired some outside people to clean it up and that caused a war. Then things calmed down but there was clearly always a Cold War with Perry. I don’t know what happened but then Perry took over again. Yancey publicly promised a CEO search and that turned out to be a lie. Now the cycle restarts with Perry’s friends at the top. 
It’s not that there haven’t been good leaders hired in or elevated. But they have generally been driven out or quit in a matter of months. 
All the while the board does nothing. It’s not clear there is any accountability for the CEOs. 
And for years we didn’t have proper HR leadership with the experience to navigate this. 
It’s all very sad.",0

Can't really think of any. I've been with the company for over 8 years.,0
"They expect a VERY specific type of employee;
- nice but not too 'friendly' otherwise it's not professional
- we are told to 'make a connection' and 'quiet nonconformity' but apparently talking to customers about how their day is, or what brings them to the area for work/travel etc is not professional and too 'friendsy' 
- staff that have been working there for a few years talk to the manager about what you're doing wrong, whether you're in the backroom more when they're not around etc and can't feel like you're friends with such senior staff as you always feel watched as if they're the manager
- EVERY little thing you do that is not the perfect aesopian is scrutinised to the point where it is very unattainable unless you're a typical 'hipster/brunswick/fitzroy/vegan' style employee who thinks aesop if life - you can't make conversation with customers about things unrelated to product apparently as it's too bubbly and unprofessional 
- manager feedback is sometimes inaccurate and completely wrong (they are not usually on the floor)
- head office people often think they are on a high horse and when they visit the store they are observing and judging your every move and will talk to the managers about it
- the company as a whole can be pretentious and a bit 'wanky' - with some products essentially being 'anti-aging' (anti-oxidant/vitamin C) but we are not allowed to say anti-aging 
-everyone sucks up to head office 

If you're the perfect Aesop cookie cutter employee you will love it, but if not be prepared to be judged as basic and sub standard. So much for quiet nonconformity.",0
"Free ice cream, flexible schedule.",1
"Fairly competitive salary, however the district managers/upper level management expected SMs to pay from their own pockets for staff incentives (well, there was a ""budget"" for it but you couldn't even buy a pizza, let alone several ones (eg. during Boxing Day when you couldn't even leave for a break) or take the team out to an acceptable, cheap restaurant. Benefits (a few years ago) were ...ok... not much, not terribly useful. I felt it was a fake place, fake smiles, fake white coats, fake ""family heritage story"" (Kiehl's has been bought by L'Oreal in 2000.... most products now are really just L'Oreal products in different packaging. Also, the products are not all natural. However, I will say that some products are quite good and I still recommend it, even after all this time). The upper management just told us to come up with business strategies on our own. Sure, the product education was at high standard but not the business education opportunities. Perhaps it has changed. Moving up was challenging into head office positions or district manager positions.",0

"- Struggling to become self-sustainable but weak leadership and general sense of discontent and mistrust make the outlook less than optimistic. Still figuring out how to consolidate strategic business goals with lofty company mission.
- No support for professional growth. Hard work or experience isn't rewarded. It's not about title or promotion (as a reviewer implied below) but the fact that there's zero support or structure for something as basic as learning new skills, honing existing ones, taking on new responsibilities, and broadening one's horizon. And managers shut their ears when an IC raises concerns about stagnation. Don't expect to go anywhere in this company.
- Incompetent middle managers. No idea how to lead a team, induce trust, delegate, or deliver. 
- Executive team trying to hide the fact that there's something seriously wrong with the company. It only exacerbates the lack of trust.",0

"- The ""free product"" is really just items that have been returned, and there is no guarantee it hasn't been tampered with, which is why it can't be re-shelved, fair enough. But for me, it's that they use it as a ""work perk"" when really it's just gifted garbage, or what would be discarded anyways 
- The job expectations (product memorization, ingredient memorization, price memorization, strict wording and phrasing, strict grooming standards and dress code, hand consultations* (see a later note), constant training videos and modules and quizzes) vs. the compensation do NOT align
- Middle management is incredibly out of touch with what it means to pay a living wage. They expect high-end and luxury while paying poverty wages
- Consent culture: hand-care/skin-care demonstrations are a MUST in this job. In that you as the sales associate are required to wash other people's hands for them. A very real response I was given when I brought up concerns of people not wanting to be touched, or sales associates not comfortable doing that (especially in a pandemic): ""People don't know they want it until it's happening, and then they enjoy it."" Creepy.

Shift rotations are horrible. Certain coworkers will hide and avoid actual manual work. Supervisors don't care how much work needs to get done but it better get done within a eight hour time frame. No oppurtunity for advancement unless your willing to put 5-10 years in certain roles.,0
"There is not work-life balance. It's exhausting. Another downside is the crazy number of extra hours that you must do (sometimes illegal shifts of more than 10 hours of work in a roll at the bars/restaurants). The management board is also immature and some of them can treat young people poorly, with a bad direction or no orientations/trainings at all.",0

"TOMS is a company with a passion for giving making the people friendly and supportive of one another; they also like to have fun together. Different company traditions like the opportunity to go on a Giving trip, attend a company-hosted, 3-day annual retreat, participate in local service projects, and have various events and happy hours make it fun. 

Most folks work on a laptop and their desks are in large spacious areas. This promotes face to face interaction and group brainstorming for ""the next big thing"". 

The office environment is fun - spiral slides take you from the second floor down the the first floor where a barista serves up your favorite coffee or tea beverage free of charge every morning. You can expect to be challenged to an afternoon ping pong game to get over the daily slump, and the dog friendly environment means cuddly friends to say hello to during your walk through the hallways. 

A different food truck comes everyday during breakfast and lunch in case you didn't pack one for yourself. You can burn off the additional calories in the free, nightly fitness programs offered on-site. Classes range from kickboxing to yoga and TRX. 

It's not uncommon to leave work with your colleagues to get happy hour or grab dinner together. Your desk will likely get decorated on your birthday, and the several lounge areas allow you to do some work on your laptop from a couch with your feet up.",1

"This review has been a long time coming. And regardless of the cultural issues that plague Indiegogo's management styles and decision-making processes, I'd like this review to serve as a transparent breakdown of why you should avoid the recruiting mumbo jumbo and ask for the figures.

Before we dive into the cons, Here are the pros:

- Mostly great people to work with, especially those in the entry level to middle management positions. These people are talented, unencumbered by the daily politics of Indiegogo and really don't know any better. They're just awesome, smart and eager to get work done.

- Nicer office space than some places",1

Following a rapid interview process and coming onboard, I was taken through an extensive and excellent onboarding/training program. It is evident that the leadership team is strategic and intentional about their decisions,  which trickles down to every level of the organization. They are led by a phenomenal CEO, who is extremely personable and passionate about the brand. My interactions thus far with colleagues have been remarkeably positive - with most hungry to mentor and learn from one another. This organization truly values their employees both on a professional and personal level.",1

"Great flexibility with shifts, brilliant training and promotion opportunities.",1
"NO accountability - many senior and junior level employees have been able to get away with unacceptable behavior (stealing, lying, disrespect to their jr. level employees) because C level turns a blind eye or feels unequipped to handle disciplinary actions. 
Freelance/contract staff are not valued or rewarded for their hard work, although they keep the company functioning and in operation.
Many people have been discouraged by lack of & change in leadership. The two biggest thorns in the side of the company are last-minute changes to enormous campaigns and projects, and un-vetted & unequipped director- and VP-level leaders. 
TOMS has lost an uncountable number of talented people because of the stifling environment created by the above, along with unrealistic budgets, and an uneven distribution of power and resources.  Many manager and coordinator level workers are not properly managed or monitored for efficiency, and abuse company resources and time due to the lack of attention placed from the mid-level down.",0

Double standards is a base on which this company holds, head office are pretentious and entitled creatures, never say “hi” to you. No manners whatsoever, but unrealistic expectations about sales associates and how they should serve customers. Favouritism towards those who suck up on to managers, the rest gets bullied and do not feel safe to talk to HR. Some teams quit and instead of opening investigations, HR hires new people. Soon Aesop will be turned into Boots for rich people. Lots of employees feel gaslighted and can’t speak up because they are threatened to be pushed to quit. Some managers are liars.

The education system has suffered terribly and as a result, turnover and knowledge is evident. The ""fight tooth-and-nail for Kiehl's"" folks have fled. Plenty of notable product failures are a result of a disconnect with the true Kiehl's core of foundations and what gave Kiehl's hedging power amongst consumers in the cosmetic market.

Extreme micro management. There is a very insidious culture of snide bullying and passive aggression from senior management in NSW office- have heard stories of RBMs and managers having a group chat in which they mock and gossip about their staff members.

You will be denied opportunities to progressive further in the company if you do not fit a very specific mould, aka if you are a normal person and don't act like a robot. 

Lack of support given to POC employees who experience racism from customers while working in store.

Casual employees are treated terribly and were stood down with no support from the company during the last few lockdowns in NSW and Victoria, despite the company having record profits.

"The company is changing and they’re asking you to do a lot more then what they want to pay you. You’re obligated to stand up and do more then what they’re paying you for because they say “growth is an option” but people stay in their same positions for years upon years. They don’t want to give you raises based on your performance because it’s “by chance” since you don’t make commission. The bonus structure is based off your goal for the month, so even if you work your butt off and others aren’t they still get the bonus; or you don’t get bonus at all. They also changed it to where you have bonus be based on your “Trend” from the last two months so they raise your goals to make it more unachievable if you are meeting your marks. Very repetitive with everyday day to day tasks. Customer base ranges significantly.",0

Management is muddled and full of petty popularity contests. If you can’t play the game and be “BrewDog” you won’t progress despite skills. Bit culty.
They make vague or real promises of progression that they don’t follow through on, leaving people stuck at one level for a long time when they could have been pursuing opportunities elsewhere or having their skills properly used by the company.

"I worked at TOMS for almost five years. I started as an intern back in 2010, when the company had only given one million pairs of shoes, and I moved to full time employment in a few departments over the course of my time there. I worked long hours, the pay was below what other folks in my job areas were working, and I would not have traded a moment of that five years to work for anyone else. The magic inside that company was palpable. The energy employees gave to one another was positive and wonderful. I grew as a person and as a professional, and I could not have asked for a better start to my career. Like any experience, what you have to gain is equal to what you put in. I went in with an open mind, I was ready to work hard. As a result, I was able to learn from some of the brightest minds in marketing and international development; I was able to gain exposure to multiple fields in a startup environment; I have an incredibly rich and diverse network. Almost every time I think about my days there, I smile. 

I also would not have been able to work at the next incredible company I found without having worked at TOMS first. It was an irreplaceable learning experience.",1

Biggest pro was working for a brand that truly kept it's vision on it's mission. Which is why I was so bummed that my coworkers were so cold and clicque-y. I left solely due the environment in my department.",1
"However, there are significant downsides that potential employees should be aware of. The pay is notably low, to the point where it's not uncommon for employees to qualify for food stamps and state health care, which is embarrassing for a company that positions itself as a luxury brand. The management style is problematic, with many employees' concerns and issues being ignored by higher-ups. Despite frequent promises of opportunities for growth and development within the company, Aesop often hires externally, leaving many employees feeling strung along.
The work culture also has a cult-like atmosphere, which can be uncomfortable and off-putting. It's disheartening to work for a luxury brand and yet earn so little that, even with an employee discount, the hourly wage equates to less than the cost of a bottle of soap. Overall, while there are some positive aspects to working at Aesop, the cons significantly overshadow them. 
Make sure before you send a “Let’s thrive not Survive” email to the entire company, people are not in the poverty threshold of their area.",0

Literally there were 4 of us working in  a store that has mall hours. In addition, the company likes to say that they want their employees to advance into other positions and grow within the company.

"It's really nice to be part of a company that truly believes in a better tomorrow and does everything it can to make the world a better place - a world where equity, justice and good exists. This company truly cares deeply about its mission and its employees. It knows that working for positive change takes hard work and genuine effort from everyone. This company is all about action when it counts and really uses its money to help where it counts most. That's been even more evident during these times of great social unrest and a pandemic with so many in need. And while it takes care of the world, it also takes care of its employees. For example, when the pandemic first started and before it was even a thing for companies to do, TOMS gave ( and continues to give) employees a $600 stipend to set up their own home office and gives monthly stipend of $50 for internet and another $50 for cell phone. And with all the social unrest that's been going on, TOMS has gathered its employees multiple times to listen, learn and discuss how social inequity and injustice is hurting us all and learn how to become strong allies. And for business matters, employees can ask questions during our regular virtual All Staff meetings or Global Brand conferences where the LT will answer directly and honestly - we just have to ask the questions.
 The company feels focused and aligned and I see a bright future ahead. I'm excited to continue being part of a company that cares so deeply about doing good in the world and especially for each other. This is the kind of place where your coworkers become your friends for life. People really love and support each other in a very genuine way. Even in the virtual environment you can feel how warm and friendly TOMS continues to be.",1

"Once a company that took on the world, they inspired people, impacted people's lives in imaginable ways.

"Aesop is chronically understaffed. This is not just an issue in individual regional markets, but at headquarters as well. Aesop will demand a lot from you without providing the resources to accomplish those goals, such as appropriate staffing. They will work you to the bone and do not care about providing you a schedule that allows for a work life balance. I am part time and work about three days a week, of those three days I am consistently scheduled for Saturdays and Sundays every single weekend, despite having ample availability on week days. Its May and I haven't been able to go to my visit my local parents since Christmas because they work weekdays. Schedules are only published one week in advance, so say goodbye to making plans with friends or even scheduling something as simple as a doctor's visit. Even though you may work part time and be compensated part time, Aesop feels entitled to all 7 days of your week. They don't make taking vacation easy- the earliest they will approve vacation time, no matter how small (say a long weekend), is 1 month out. This makes travel plans involving airfare and hotels next to impossible.  

Lastly, I have worked a store where heat was frequently 10 degrees below federal labor laws. Numerous communications were sent to corporate who respond promptly, but failed to get a repairman in promptly. During the winter, I often felt sick leaving from severely cold temperatures in store. Aesop never apologized for such an unacceptable operational failure and instead blamed unpredictable weather. I was expected to be in an amazing mood performing at 100% when I literally could not feel my toes. During these winter months, I realized that Aesop is not the company that I had once so much admired as a customer.

"EVERYTHING. - You will be harassed, micro managed and scrutinized on every level - pay increase is a joke, they gave us a bonus this year to offset the rising cost of living that when you do the math on was about one extra hour added to your check for the year. Consultants still making way below the average retailer. Save yourself the disappointment and go work somewhere they value your time - your upper management will truly be worthless and do nothing upper management acting like they saving the world( from the comforts of their home) - excessive amounts of solo shifts, they will never staff correctly these stores it will forever be you and one to two other staff members max but they will speak as if they are running a 20 person+ production to you -understaffed good luck using the PTO they will dangle over your head like an aesopian carrot - NO POC in upper management, micro aggressive and HIGH key racist. Also extremely tone deaf- you will be harassed and hounded on why nobody wants to shop at a store that has no marketing done  - they will act as you work in an art space and Not a retail store - be prepared for people to quit all the time including higher ups and your own coworkers nobody stays long and those that do prayers for them

"Upper management is a disaster; complete lack of direction, edX has lost sight of its mission; getting outmaneuvered by competition, always playing catch-up; culture is a mess; morale is nonexistent; divide and tension between business unit groups; constantly undermined by partners; the good workers are undervalued leading to high turnover",0

"But I left, why? It doesn't fit for me anymore, and I can't find a role in such a small company that can help me grow. It was the right time for me to move on, but it doesn't mean you will face the same problem that I had. Do your own research and talk with teams, and you will know whether it is a good fit or not. 

1) Tech stack was built for scale but we don't have a scale problem (yet). This includes maintaining and transitioning a complex SOA into a platform which allows people to do quick product iteration. The process is and will be painful, but on the other side, the old tech stack was very advanced and I don't think it will be a bad idea to work on it and improve on it. 

2) Business is still slowly growing, and we are not a rocket ship (yet?). This means that there are many tough challenges and pains ahead of you. 

3) Really slow decision making and management lack of focus. People are assigned to many tasks and management can be very short-term focused sometimes. There are also lots of politics in certain teams but you should directly ask your hiring manager and set up expectation clearly.

4) Very complicated product and business lines. Things can be confusing.",0

"The change in how TOMS gives has really disconnected everyone from the cause. TOMS supports so many organizations and without the in person giving trips it’s hard to connect to those causes deeply. This change also hasn’t connected with customers the way the one for one model did. 

Employee turnover is such a problem that there’s a program to address it by paying employees more to stay a little longer to help with the cross training and transition. That’s was just a band aid as not enough is being done to address why people are leaving. There’s always job postings in certain departments. That should tell you all you need to know about how those teams are treated.",0
"In the last year, the company has made more changes then  they did the previous 166 years. And while some of these changes were necessary, many of the changes also changed the overall morale of the employees. Up until the new president came along, even though Kiehls was a large company, it had a small, family feel. Now, while the new president and VP are smart business-savvy women, lots of employees, who have been with the brand for years, have lost their jobs (many corporate layoffs, elimination of retail positions, and store closings).  While I understand that the previous president needed to make wiser business decisions, thus forcing this president to “stop the bleeding”, so to speak, The company now feels more amoral then before. The family- feel environment previously is gone. 
In addition, Kiehls pushes empathy, and yet, upper management, HR, corporate are some of the most un-empathetic (Not to mention un-professional) people I’ve worked for.  
With all the changes, the hierarchy has also changed. Fine. But most of the time, you don’t know who to go to for what, and when you do, you don’t even get a response. 
I was always proud to represent and work for Kiehls. But 2018 changed that for me.",0

"Working at edX used to be great before they got acquired by 2U.
Benefits (one of the main reasons edX was considered a great place to work) were slashed. Cost of living adjustments to salaries and WFH stipends disappeared. 
2U has made it clear they don't care about retaining legacy edX employees. Transparent communication that existed throughout the company is gone: to get anything done or communicate anything, employees have to navigate mysterious, vague, bureaucratic processes. 
Turnover is at an all-time high, yet roles are not being backfilled and the work is being piled onto the desks of remaining edX employees.
If you ask about comp raises or cost of living adjustments, you are given the ""you should be here for the mission, not money"" response. This may have worked when edX was a non-profit, but being told you should be mission-driven by a millionaire CEO on a Zoom call at one of his many residences is kind of a joke.
Little to no moral and emotional support was granted during the pandemic. Work was at an all-time high for the whole organization, we got a small handful of (2-3) 'wellness days'.

Customers are GENERALLY pretty nice, with some notable exceptions. You also get holiday hours and the occasional weekend off, which is pretty unheard of in most bars.

Working at TOMS was an incredible experience and I loved every person on my team. They are creative, passionate, fun, burned out, unappreciated, looked over, and now that I am gone... I think of them often and wish they could all find a better place that will treat them right. The problem starts at the TOP! You must be ready to play politics because if you are not on the list of ""favorites"" they will muscle you out or eventually fire you. How does a company such as this, one that claims to want the best for the world, treat it's very own so terribly? It's a shame. It's honestly a shame and there is real ugliness in that playground of an office. It truly breaks my heart how underhanded things are there... beware! If you can get into the short-list of ""favorites"" then you are set. Otherwise, you will eventually have the same sentiment as the majority of people on here.

"Given its ease of hire,  job is boring, sometimes solitary, and you are sometimes treated as if you're not part of the team.",0
"The internal culture of the company does not seem to align with the image of the brand. There is no sense of solidarity or humanity within the company. The business became too big and many managers could not keep up with the speed of growth therefore are under lots of stress that they take out on employees. These managers would need development, especially in people's skills, leadership and problem-solving.
There is no opportunity for consultants to give feedback on the company or discuss their problems with the Head Office, due to communication barriers. Retail is kept separately from the HQ and managers often make it difficult or impossible for consultants to get in touch with senior managers for fear of employees uncovering what is going on in the stores. They do not want employees to become to big for their boots. Ambitious team members are discouraged and put off by false information about opportunities within the company.
Managers appreciate people whom are easy to control and do not ask questions just follow orders. Creativity is not encouraged, certain managers do not seem to know what it means at all.
Store managers are often arrogant, ignorant, unsupportive and abusive. Looking from inside, it is clear that managers only care about  KPIs, shift-covers and their own days off and holidays. Employees are treated with a fake ""kindness"" behind which there are unanswered e-mails, no opportunity to grow and overworking. In return, there is little appreciation. Performance reviews are not done regularly. Many employees are extremely competitive as managers compare them with other team members.
Generally there is a sense of secrecy, due to the difficulty of communication and HQ being unapproachable.
Consultant meetings are symbolic, the company does not put any effort into organising activities for staff to bond or socialise. Many people in the HQ looks down retail staff and does not treat them equally.
Overall, a huge disappointment after the beautiful image of the brand. I wish the employee experience would be the same as the customer service that is built on empathy and trust.",0

"- WLB differs widely from team to team. Lots of people are overworked and burnt out and company culture implicitly encourages such behavior. Which leads to... - High turnover rate across many teams for a company that's supposed to be people-first and mission-driven, especially with talent from underrepresented groups. - Questionable business strategy. People are being pulled in all directions and really feeling the churn. Morale has been trending downward for a while because many employees don't feel confident about where the company is headed. - Shareholder governance not stakeholder governance, despite what the company would like you to believe.",0

Archaic view on ‘work from home’, forcing people back into the office after covid and not listening to the genuine concerns. The constant PR stunts make the job so much harder, there’s a lot of outside disdain for the CEO amongst other business owners. CEO does not think past his own gain which has negatively impacted sales in the past.",0

Great company to work for,1
"It's no lie; TOMS does occasionally promote current employees from within... it just only happens to those who are lucky enough to be on whatever short list of people who are favored by their manager. I cannot emphasize enough just how important it is to ""play the game"" of favorites to even stand a chance of getting on such a list. part of the problem is that some leaders/managers don't have a clue what their direct reports do... so rather than evaluate true merit, they evaluate personalities.

Similarly, on paper great annual reviews are used as a carrot and stick tactic to trick desperate employees to get them to work even harder than they already do. Yearly reviews are conducted... Even ""mid-year"" reviews are encouraged. However updates and check ins regarding performance should be a continuing conversation that happens monthly. Because then this shows that the company is willing to invest in their people. The carrot I mentioned earlier? That wouldn't be an issue if there were regular check ins. As a result, reviews are written and recorded, but no amount of follow through happens because the ideas become stale and too distant by time it's time to discuss again.",0

If you dared to question management you were blacklisted and found yourself without a job soon after. Everything is expected under unreasonable timelines, if you couldn't do it you were considered not fit for a ""fast-paced"" environment rather than them questioning whether they were being unrealistic. The head of people at the time (who is still there but has been shoved into another role) didn't have a clue, and would blindly do as the ceo instructed rather than caring at all about people. I still have ptsd from working there, it damaged my mental health to an extreme and I have suffered confidence issues in every role since. For the sake of your health, avoid this company.

My manager was great at putting people down, we would get on calls and I’d have to adjust fonts and small things to his liking in PowerPoint decks - this was miles below my skill set and I think he used it as a way to demean. Why don’t you adjust the font and move things yourself? Oh, you don’t know how. Always asking me to set up meetings for him like I was his assistant.

"Management - Many managers have gotten promoted to positions of power by their friends or simply because they stuck around long enough for everyone else to quit.  There was no objective evaluation on their ability to lead a team or their prior success in business.  This has resulted in a toxic environment where incompetent managers will do anything to stay on top.

Career growth - There is no opportunity for growth unless you're friends with management, no matter how talented and hardworking you are.  For this reason, many good people have left and continue to leave.

HR - This team is used as a weapon of terror by incompetent managers to force honest and hardworking employees out the door.

Culture - Company culture has gone down the drain, since you can't truly relax and have fun when you're constantly being scrutinized by a cut-throat HR department.  You have to watch what you say at all times b/c any negative comment that is overheard by the wrong person can be grounds for termination.  TOMS is now a corporation and not a family.",0

"- miscommunication, lack of direction, different objectives and goals from all ends, leaderships, managers, departments (I've been here for a while and its been like this the entire time).  The change of direction happens on a frequent basis.  
- lack of leadership - the company tends of cycle through leadership pretty frequently, especially when they don't agree with our founder, or is on a 'friend' basis.   Every time a new leader comes on board, there is on boarding and ramping up time which affects the business.  
- people who shout the loudest and talk the most, are often the ones that get recognition, not the people who work to keep the company going.  (This is why the company goes through massive turnover on an annual basis)
- People that work in this company are very passive aggressive,  people don't want to say what is reality and often run around in circles rather than attacking an issue head on. 
- HR - the team itself seems like its made up of great people but how effective they are is questionable.  It is known that they are all compensated well however the result of that is 0 to none.  
- Giving - it was once a main focus however now its been pushed aside, we used to have a giving team but they've been placed all over the place.  It was told to us that this was to incorporate giving more, but we all know the truth.  Giving comes second, not first.

Insane turnover (like nothing I've ever seen before!) which creates instability and uneasiness. Consistently low morale and truly bizarre attempts to fix it. Low pay for the industry. Star employees not given opportunity to grow internally. Minimal career growth paths here. Sexism and bias are often swept under rug because it ""wouldn't happen here."" Immature working culture.

- Staff complimentary products like free returns/written off products is in fact wrong and management alter this to make advantage of KPIs and also to gift to their favourited personnel. 
- You have to regularly cover other stores and this can be a drag, and impact your plans/travel. 
- You are judged, and although you might think this is a personal take, I have discussed this with other retail consultants at other london stores and we all feel like this. You are just a number instead of a someone with a name. 
- Its business as usual, which I know it has to be to make profit for the business etc. but the core values mean nothing. 
- Lake of actual recycling also internal, there's a lot of wastage which again, goes against Aesop ethos.

There is a lot of internal politics at play that clearly favors some over others. Even though subtle, racial and cultural discrimination are also a real thing. Preference will almost always be given to you if you're white and/or Anglo/Australian. Employee voices are very rarely listened to by upper management, and there is a clear disconnect between what happens at the Head Office and what is actually taking place in the stores. There is hardly any opportunity for upward mobility within the company too, and more often than not priority is given to external hires, and though encouraged, development plans are very rarely honored.

"Bully style leadership creates a psychologically unsafe work environment, especially for women. Managers are completely tone deaf to anything that concerns DEI. There is no proactive, data-driven decision making from leadership, which leads to constant crisis mode, unhappy partners, and employee attrition. 

There was very little, if any support or compassion from leadership during the pandemic when some employees had child care issues or others were completely isolated in lockdown. Acknowledgment of even the slightest bit of struggle put a target on your back.

Once upon a time there was at least the good feeling that you were working for a non-profit to increase access to education, and that helped to boost morale and balance out the toxicity of the culture. But when MIT spun edX off, there was no path to sustainability other than to sell to the highest bidder. Enter 2U, a publicly traded corporation that by definition must put shareholders' interests first. At least now no one has to pretend to care about partners or learners.",0

"My experience at Aēsop started as a love story, a lovely brand with impeccable design, great care of us retail consultants at the start and lovely training but this has all changed within the last year. 
The brand now focuses merely on making profit and push all retail employees on their KPIs without looking at the bigger picture. 
Management at Aēsop is horrible. Store managers all micro manage everyone and complain about everything without even doing the bare minimum chores and setting the example. In two years I have worked with 12 different employees that all left because of the toxic environment store manager created, bare in mind this year retail turnover was massive over 70%; talking behind customers and colleagues back with racist, sexist and homophobic remarks. Clearly showing favoritism towards specific staff members and comparing colleagues. Micromanaging seems like the key skills required to be a manager at Aesop as no trust is given to the staff; asking others if a certain person arrived late, if they cleaned, assuming they don’t, complaining for leaving on time…or worse, destroying any initiatives to make work life better. Passive aggressive behavior is constant, e.g. if you are quiet they say you are unprofessional, if you got a new haircut, grooming policies are sent in the group chat
Upper management such as RBM will force managers to cut people hours forbidding part timer to do overtime without even talking to them which caused me to be in big financial insecurity with no warnings. Management will talk in your name without even consulting you such as cancellation of your participation in internal opportunities without communicating it to you. 
I highly discourage anyone to work as a part-timer for Aesop as you will clearly be treated as a nobody by everyone and will be used as a chess piece to cover other stores at anytime without notice. Aesop used to ask if it was okay to cover other store sometimes which was fun but now they don’t ask you anything and will send you at the other side of the city to cover 45 mins without paying commute. If you work in a department store it will be even worse as they dont try to understand that it works completely differently than signature stores and will always compare you to them. 
If your store is not performing well you will be thrown around even giving three deliveries to do in one week, managers never helping for deliveries and always giving it to the man of the team. Working department store will also mean no free products or written off, no snacks, no samples given as managers are scared of the department store managers. 
Working as a part timer for this brand also means HR will never take your complaints seriously even if it is for bullying others.
This brand is putting stress on everyone for the surprise visits of head office and ceos of the company so everyone is always under the stress and forced to do useless tasks to appear busy. Head office staff, when visiting dont even address a word to you but just the manager. There is a serious lack of trust and respect when it comes to sickness and days off as you will be questioned whether you are really sick, be contacted on days off. For instance, my number was given to contractors of the store without my knowledge. 
The company never invest in their internal talents unless you are super close to upper management and will even reject you for moving stores if they deem your kpis to be low. They are forced to give feedback to internal opportunities rejection but never give them. There is a big lack of diversity in upper management which showcase in the mentality of the managers. I was told all Asians look the same, Asians people cant dance, Asian food looks scary or “I love working with Asians because they dont complain and work hard”.
Avoid this company as they now prioritize profit and lost their human side. Great products and great branding, all the rest is bad.",0

There is a lot of chaos in the company, which isn't always bad, but unfortunately it always feels that it's the ones at the bottom that suffer.

I gave this company 3 years of life with hopes of at least a promotion. They kept me on a part-time status working full-time hours while they hired for full-time positions from the outside. I was always on time, well dressed, and always exceeded my sales goals and never questioned guidance from management. 

The truth is Kiehl's is in the Beauty Industry, and they have a very specific idea of how they want their company to be represented. Kiehl's does not promote from within.",0

The eliminated position was also merged with my role... After all of this, I was still denied a raise or bonus by management as well as HR when making this known.",0

"My store in particular had an extremely tough time getting people to apply to work at my store - all because of pay. In the mall I used to work at, a couple stores down we had Nike paying $4.50 more per hour for the same basic sales associate position. North Face was another example paying $3.50 more per hour.
Due to that, it was extremely hard to find help so we were always short staffed and would go through chaotic Saturdays and Sundays with less than minimum coverage. You can see how that could impact your team's morale, energy and everything else. It was also very stressful and we had to do the job of multiple people at the same time, all because the company refuses to be competitive when it comes down to pay. Also, unfortunately, because the company pays so little, we end up hiring only associates who do not really care about being there at all and would call-out anytime something better would pop up during their weekend.
The company is not in a very good financial situation, hence why they do not want to increase pay, but that ends up affecting us, regular store staff, a whole bunch.
Assistant store manager pay is also, unfortunately, laughable. I was making $10.50 over my assistant manager (I was a store manager) who worked extremely hard, gave pretty much every single weekend to Vans and had to close the store at 9pm multiple times per week, stopping him from spending time with his family.
Vans used to be an amazing place to work at, I wonder what happened.",0

i do not have any cons,0
"When I started working there i thought this one of the most awesome places to work. Good benefits package, free lunch every day, cool offices....but that was about it. After a while you need more than free lunch....you need real feedback for your work, you need honest people, you need your work to be appreciated (or not if you're not doing well) but you definitely look for an honest opinion/response. 
I would hear almost every day ""you're doing an awesome work"" for almost a year, and then when it comes to performance evaluation, or to being promoted...all different kinds of complaints, ""faults"" come up. This didn't happen only to me...these is the reason why many people are leaving. The feedback you get throughout the year is FAKE! You're never ""helped"" or ""pushed in the right way"" to do better. While you keep busting your butt and think you're doing your best...your manager/supervisor may change her/his mind as she/he pleases regarding you performance. Promotion is not encouraged at all. Very disappointing...",0

No fixed working hours - as long as you do your work and perform well, which most of us do as far as I can see. 

Very good at giving productive feedback and helping each other. This also has to do with the fact that we're all working with education and our users are generally educated people (with exceptions, of course).",1

Working in a small space with only 1 or 2 other people can be miserable if placed with the wrong person.

no free ice cream which made me sad,0
"Flat business structure, not much development or progression",0
"Since the acquisition, communication has taken a nosedive. Gmail migration and a moratorium on iMail happened with a 24hour warning, important compensation information is shared only in AMAs, and six months into the acquisition, there is still no integration with the new parent company. The company claims transparency, yet when employees ask about compensation, retention, or morale, the tone-deaf response is to ""buy into the mission"" or ""in-office events"" when the majority of the workforce wants to be remote. Going from a non-profit with an amazing mission to a for-profit company whose mission is to make really expensive online graduate programs not suck is a bit of a letdown -- the only upside would be if we were paid like a for-profit company. Raise discussions will happen in April and I highly doubt that edX employees will see a compensation increase to a competitive salary range. Job recs have gone un-posted and un-filled and edX is pretty severely understaffed. edX has lost the trust of many of its employees and the new parent company seems as though it does not want to keep edXers around for the long haul.

oh and post-acquisition, the benefits are awful. We went from BCBS to Cigna. Thumbs down.",0

Company getting good but I’m in same position,0
"I have been working at TOMS for almost 3 months now, and it has been an extremely positive experience.  I'm told I came in after a time where morale was low and lay-offs unfortunately had to happen, so I was lucky not to have experienced that. My fellow employees that have been around for a long time say that the company is feeling the best it has in a while and everything is looking up.  Free barista in the mornings, free work-out classes during the day, dogs all around the office.  The best part though, is the team I work on.  The entire team loves each other and is always willing to help one another.  It's a very positive environment.  I know that there are other teams that aren't as happy, so I feel very lucky to be a part of such an amazing team.  The giving aspect is awesome.  They're bringing back Giving Trips, and there are always opportunities to ""give back"" here, which is a great feeling.  After a bit of a lull, I feel management is getting their ""giving"" vision back on track, and it will only get better.  If the job you are seeking here is a part of the E-Commerce team, I HIGHLY recommend!  Jim, the CEO, seems very involved and connected to his employees.  He's always walking around and talking to everyone in the office, and is a great supporter of his employees' interests and goals.  I haven't seen Blake (TOMS founder) much since I started working here, as he and his wife recently had a baby.",1

"1. Code of conduct is not honoured. I reported a violation of a code of conduct breach. Instead of listening, HR and management demoted me to try to silence me. 2. Corruption. Many RBMs and Managers hire their friends and give them unfair advantage over other staff. 3. Toxic work culture. Most RBMs and managers that I came into contact with engage in gaslighting behaviour. Fickle store bitchiness that has nothing to do with performance is valued above actual direct communication with integrity focused actions. 4. Unsafe work conditions, I worked in multiple retail spaces that had faulty maintenance issues that directly affected both staff and customers health and safety. For instance a heavy countertop piece that fell off multiple times a day. It was reported and Ignored by management. I also cut my hands on sharp joinery daily. 5. Favouritism of city spaces Don’t bother working for this company in a suburban store, leadership do not care about you and will actively prioritise city stores over outer region spaces, despite outer region spaces yielding more revenue and KPIs. 6. Racism and ageism Some really discriminatory and ignorant behaviour towards people of colour by both white and other people of colour folks. There is a facade of being inclusive that is not actually followed through in the culture. Same to people over 45/50 years old. 7. Culture ‘pushes down’ instead of ‘lifts up’ Absolutely no effort put into retaining staff and assisting their professional development. There is frameworks in place by head office but managers and RBMs do not complete them and clearly get away with it. If you would like to see progression in retail be prepared to work for minimum wage for 5+ years before being even considered for any step up. I personally was bullied, excluded from meetings, made to feel like I did not earn my position. 8. Hiring process takes months 9. Be careful if taking on higher duties, as no job discription will be given to you and you will be buddies up with another manager who also has no clue. Then you will be criticised for not following an apparent procedure that was never actually communicated. 10. I was told by management when I was in higher duties to book staff over legal limits. RBM had no issue with breaking employment law.",0

"The job is pretty easy so they make the little things into huge issues. Like if theres a water spill, instead of cleaning it up they huddle around the puddle and brainstorm of the most efficient way of cleaning it. You have to go to monthly meetings which sucks if you're off that day. Managers can be cool, depends on how dedicated yours is to the companies ethos. Some managers act like aesop is *their* brand and take it very seriously, others know its just a job and want you to just do well while youre there. Do not expect to always have a manager, and you can not move up unless youve been there a certain amount of time even if youre already doing the job.

"I passed up other, much better paying opportunities for a position that was not as it was purported to be in description or how it was described in my multiple interviews. The department has various issues with organization, compliance, and constant power struggles. Things as minor as a weekly schedule for all employees are unsurmountable tasks for management. Pay and benefits seem ok compared to other companies in the rural town but are not comparable for other companies of its standing. Expect them to want significant experience and a degree but don't want to pay much over minimum wage. Human Resources does not serve employees but seems to only side with management and the company as well as cover up or ignore internal issues when convenient for them, even when those issues involve health and safety. The job has a lot of potential but they need to clean house and fix some internal problems before this will be a desirable job.",0

* Career development resources are available, but they're not well advertised. 

* There is a vibe that the company lacks transparency, but what it actually struggles with is timely communication. Thankfully this appears to be changing.

* Leadership is admittedly something of a mess right now and has been for the past year and a half. Playing devil's advocate though- can we really expect anything less from a period in the company's history that saw the departure of its President and the on-boarding of major financial partners?",0

"Lack of business investment in systems or It support in critical business area's. Excel is overused and making your day to day tasks more difficult. 

No structure or process for career development which links to pay rises. Brewdog burns vast amounts on large marketing or international expansion projects, but do not provide staff with pay rises. You can receive pay rises but depends on if your face fits. 

No annual pay rises to match inflation. 

In some cases job descriptions are not followed, they can be changed without being documented. If this happens there is no link to pay progression or career development. 

Longer serving staff members are treated different to shorter staff members. Meaning you can be treated unfairly based on time served. 

High expectations on improvements, projects and solutions, however workload not taken into consideration or additional resource acquired to achieve this. 

Reactive last minute scrappy mentality approach to projects/process which link to your individual tasks is company culture. Meaning there is no or lack of basic process, this makes managing your workload difficult and more stressful. 

High level projects or actions come from the top & are spread by weak management who entertain the owners requests and spread the grey actions throughout the business. 

Company does not work to IS9001 throughout the business meaning there is no strong QMS which encompasses and drives process and continual improvement in all business areas. 

Long working hours with no overtime. You can end up with a large workload which can't be completed in your standard working hours, meaning you have to stay late. You will not be payed overtime for your hard work which for office staff is written in your contact. If your concerns are escalated to management you may be ignored. 

Poor leadership and high turnover of staff in senior management positions. This is also for staff in lower level positions. Whenever this happens senior management/management say 'They wasn't the right fit for Brewdog'. This is a ridiculous statement everyone can be wrong. It would make it a better company to address the issues rather than use this excuse. 

If someone leaves in most cases the jobs are not back filled, the extra workload is pushed on to other members of staff. This has a knock on effect, will make you want to look for a new job. 

The way the business operates may not get the best out of your experience. It can also hinder your development due to the poor working environment. 

Unfair pay between different departments.

HR non-existent they only appear at the end for your exit interview, I didn't find them approachable. 

They will look external for staff rather than develop and promote from within.",0

It's made the past several months more chaotic, but it seems like we're starting to settle into a more collaborative and focused operational cadence.  There are certainly areas where we could improve in terms of culture -- ivy league graduates are massively overrepresented, for example, and like most tech companies diversity could be much better -- but people at Coursera, especially executives, take these problems very seriously and I find the focus on improving these areas encouraging.  While there has been a lot of change in the past year, I think the changes to company direction and organizational structure will be good things in the long run, and we're already starting to see the increased strategic focus, operational discipline, and alignment of our resourcing with the needs or our partners and learners paying off.  Overall, I'm optimistic for Coursera's future and for my future at Coursera.",0
"Favoritism. If you're not favored, there is no growth. Lots of talk/sessions about career development but no actual growth save a few people. People lead projects because they are favored, implement bad solutions and get recognition because they don't look at actual outcome.

They claim living wages but being sent home from shifts early when quiet means so weeks you'd earn less than 200 quid.

The HR department is setup solely to cover the company and not look after the interests of the staff.

I was sexually assaulted in the bar by a drunk customer. I asked my manager to have him removed from the bar only to be told no as he was the managers friend and made to work right in front of him as he was sat at the bar. When I talked to my manager the next day his response was 'well if you felt that uncomfortable why didn't you walk out?', my response was 'i have a job to do'.

The manager would routinely get us to cook the books so he could use the safe as his presonal bank. When I objected to this my hours got cut as he didn't want me doing closes so he could continue with this practice.

Routinely sworn at during shifts when manager having a bad day. Even called a names via email for pointing out a flaw in his rotering.

The hire/fire attitude is off the scale, so much staff turnover. If you're looking for job security this isn't the place.

Made to sell beer that was knowingly off.

Bought 3k worth of shares, doubled to 6k with staff investment scheme, paid for them, told they had gone through and I was waiting on the certificate. When I left despite the company having had my money for 5 months I was told I could no longer have the staff bonus and the whole thing got cancelled.

"I could go on and on on the cons. Almost every benefit that’s advertised when I began working there no longer exists. -Profit Share schemes were a joke, corporate even blocked work chats discussing displeasure with the results of it. -Hiring near constantly while running with barebones crew to skimp on money, left dealing with staff who had no idea what they’re doing (no fault of theirs) - A drink after your shift was always a nice way to wind down with your colleagues and discuss the hectic day, these are being axed - pay increase compared to workload increase going from regular staff to duty manager is ridiculous. You can earn more money in a lot of baseline bar jobs than you can as a manager at Brewdog - Certain managers are exceptional but more than most can be exceptionally rude and genuinely put you off wanting to come to work - a 1 pound pay increase was offered, bringing duty manager wage to 12.35 an hour, which is still super low considering the workload, but this increase is negated by the fact that your break is no longer going to be paid - anything under 10 hours now only grants you a 20 minute break, managers seem to rota 9 and a half hours quite a lot now… -company culture couldn’t be further than “punk”, don’t really know how they even feel comfortable using a term like that considering how corporate of a company they are. Come to Brewdog and express who you are! but only if who you are falls in line with what your manager wants! -Only takes a quick google of the company to reveal a lot about them…",0

"Like any startup, Indiegogo has had its ups and downs, and sometimes people like to latch onto one bad quarter as a reason to complain. A small group of employees here are not the most appreciative of the workspace and like to complain.

Targets can be quite aggressive which can be exciting for some but stressful for others.

Since Indiegogo is so flexible and understanding about work schedule and styles, sometimes work load gets unevenly distributed as people take advantage of the generosity of the system way too much.",0

G.Door says I have to post at least five words in this section.,1
"TOMS employees are welcoming, supportive, and friendly. TOMS compensation, benefits, and HR policies are generous. The TOMS work environment is open, fun, and conducive to creative work. Perks like free coffee bar, happy hour Fridays, and free shoes are nice, but what makes TOMS a special place to work?

Even with the enormous success of the last several years, and the growth, TOMS is still small enough that my individual impact is felt every day, hard work is noticed and appreciated, and failures too. This is not a company for people who want to hide and just come to a job.

When I think about how and where I want to spend most of my waking hours, I want to work hard, feel valued, be compensated, and grow as a person and professional. TOMS is an exceptional place to have all of those things. 

TOMS has added management and structure, but the organization is still very flat. There is a small group of executive level managers and the CEO. There are some additional levels of management but the titles don't really drive the way people interact. I have worked in organizations where it seemed almost everybody was some type of manager from AVP (Associate VP), VP, SVP (senior VP), EVP (Executive VP), SEVP (Senior Executive VP) (seriously). How you were treated in those companies and your ability to get anything done depended on which of those letters followed your name. 

Some people prefer the structure and predictability of these organizations, where the career ladder is a clear path from the bottom to the top and if you're not interested in climbing that ladder, you can hide and put in a minimal effort. It won't really put your job or the organization at risk. 

Some of the negative reviewers talk about a company that they don't recognize anymore. They reminisce about a better time, and wish that TOMS was still the scrappy club of interns working out of a small warehouse. Fortunately for millions of people on the receiving end of TOMS generous giving, TOMS survived and has grown beyond it's start-up days. Unfortunately for some early team members, that growth brought structural change and organizational rigor that is not for them. 

If you want the freedom and craziness of a start-up, with hungry entrepreneurs working out of an apartment, then TOMS might feel too structured. If you prefer the structure and predictability of a large company, TOMS may feel too laid back, and maybe even chaotic. 

Many of the early employees deserve credit for their part in launching something truly special. However, TOMS can't remain a cool start-up forever. Some of the management is no-nonsense, some of the employees have egos, and some days it feels like a job. But, it's almost always fun and almost always rewarding. I would never want to go back to my old employers, and they will have to drag me kicking and screaming out of here.",1

"-Can still be very 'startup-y' in terms of organizational structure, HR/bookkeeping, information management, etc. With the flexibility and independence of working at a start up comes the BS too---different teams using different processes and platforms to communicate and store information and the disorganization that follows from that, sometimes unclear roles/hierarchies/career paths, snafus in tracking PTO or transferring benefit plans, etc. This is clearly something management is working to improve but there is still progress to be made.

There are many very passionate people who work at Indiegogo who care deeply about things outside of work, which makes it a very interesting and enjoyable place to work. It's also pretty fun, employees organize happy hours frequently and every few months organize an unofficial employee trip to Tahoe or the Russian River. Also, major opportunity to grow professionally and take ownership of a new project or develop skills and transfer to a completely new team. Many people who run large programs now were given the opportunity to supervise a small pilot that then became very successful. Also, many people who started on customer support teams have grown their skills and are now working on product management, design, sales, and strategy teams.

"Depending on the bar/manager communication from management can be a bit ropey, and ops are often extremely slow to sign off on Rotas, so you could be sat on Thursday the 28th and have no idea what hours you'll be working week beginning 30th which is a joke. 

Penny pinching from HQ means hours can and will be cut dramatically, full time or part time this ""living wage employer"" couldn't care less if they have to hack their bar staff down to 10 hours a week to save on wage costs.

Also wastage, minor repairs and breakages (any losses the bar makes) come directly from the staff's ""Unicorn Fund"" which is basically an end of year bonus - a bit of a kick in the teeth to lose a chunk of that (especially after having your hours slashed) on account of broken glasses and a few pints of wasted beer.

They also make employees pay out of their own pockets to make up for lost profits if the till is down more than £4 - which is frankly absolutely disgusting, particularly on nights when your bar has taken in excess of £10k. The till is down £30 - all staff on close will have to fork up that money between them to cover it. No other bar I have worked in has had a policy like this. It is a joke, and a disgusting abuse of your staff to force them to pay out of pocket for the sake of a few mistakes. Staff who are made victims of con men and thieves also have to pay out of pocket to make up for money lost. 

Don't expect them to warn you beforehand, but they also won't pay you for your trial shift. My trial shift was only a couple of hours, but I'm aware of one employee who did their trial shift on a busy night, stayed till close (without being given the chance to go home or warned they'd be staying till close) had to pay for their own taxi, then was brought back for another trial shift. This employee worked about 10 hours for Brewdog with no pay, which I think is disgusting. 
""Interview process"" or no, Jobseekers should not be taken advantage of for free labour in such a way. 

No other business I have worked for has been so ready to take money from its employees - and has not done so while plastering all over its branding that it is a living wage employer, oh so ethical and incredibly punk rock.

I've also had managers who weren't very good with dealing with sexual harassment and threatening behaviour from customers. I've witnessed managers who have continued to serve very drunk customers who have been verbally abusive, as well as male customers who have made unwanted sexually aggressive comments toward female members of staff. I don't know why managers would prioritise milking a few extra quid from threatening/pervy customers over staff welfare and the comfort of other customers - doesn't make sense to me.

Don't be taken in by the branding: Brewdog is extremely corporate, and without intervention from solid managerial staff, HQ will prioritise maximising profits over staff welfare in any way they can.",0

"To be clear, I absolutely would *not* recommend that you work here. One of the biggest cons is the general feeling of malaise at the organization. edX was recently acquired by 2U. The merger will be complete by the end of October, so maybe things will improve then, but I doubt it. 
It's important to note that 2U is not currently running edX directly, so everything that is a bummer about working here is due to the leadership team edX has had for a long time. The leadership team are ineffectual, duplicitous, political, and wildly dismissive of the staff. They practice favoritism, bully middle management and front line staff, and seem to be utterly directionless. 
The only thing that may be worse than the leadership team is the product itself. The edX platform is really buggy and frustrating. If you don't speak English, your options for learning are extremely limited. Getting a certificate is only made challenging by hurdles in the software, not necessarily the course material. 
The course quality is lacking as well. edX has no formal process for ensuring the quality of the courses the partners publish. This results in typos on just about every page, quizzes being graded incorrectly, and complete failures of proctoring software. 
Nobody in leadership has any real interest in fixing these problems (and those mentioned certainly aren't the only ones). 2U bought edX for it's user base so they could market their online degree to a large group of learners that are used to online learning. I think the modest revenue edX brings in is also appealing to 2U, but it's not really enough to warrant a lot of investment by the company. 
That's the main problem. edX just feels like it has no future. It's sad.",0

"Aesop's well-known attention to detail and precise execution stops  just past the customer experience. Communication internally is often disorganized, execution chaotic and or sloppy, and communication between departments and between the office/retail segments is muddled and mixed messages (often contradictory) are common. Support can be lax, detached, or simply not present or effective.

Pay is generally below market-value.

You will not have ultimate hiring or firing prerogative, and the recruitment system is reactive and slow and fails to meet the needs of the business- if you lose a team member, it may take months to replace them. You will be allowed to have the minimum amount of staff required to keep the doors open, leaving the business vulnerable.

Your scheduling will simply be a function of profit rather than what's best for your individual business, and likely won't allow you to truly develop or motivate your team.  

The review process seems dreaded by both retail and some support staff because it is ineffective and demotivating. 

Turnover has historically been high in many departments and markets. 

Communication, support, and even culture will exist primarily in your inbox or on an internal site. You will rarely hear from your company's leadership- this is not a company who believes in top-down motivation.  You'll often see the same mistakes made over and over again by a variety of departments, and you as the manager will be held to account for those inefficiencies and organizational defects.",0

They ask for feedback and will listen to your concerns or suggestions and then go “I understand, but this is just the Aesop way” what’s the point of asking? Store managers are more like assistant managers who are micromanaged and not trusted to run a store. No one in upper management never smiled …….not because they were upset but it was the “culture” If you aren’t white (Australian) or Asian descent (highest racial clientele fyi) don’t think of getting promoted in upper management.",0

"I started at TOMS when the office was in a warehouse in Santa Monica, it was a cramped space without any ventilation, but it was awesome. Back then, everyone had a voice, people were willing to collaborate and it truly had a ""we're in this together"" vibe to it.

But over the years, as TOMS became bigger and started selling more, the company started hiring more executive level people that completely changed the culture. What was once an ego-less company became filled with giant egos of executives all trying to push their own agendas, hiring their own people and demanding their own private offices even when TOMS never had any before - TOMS founder Blake Mycoskie used to sit out in the open with all the regular people. 

Now, there's an HR department that doesn't care about you - they're all gunning for promotions and don't want to speak up for the employees. There are layers and layers of new managers and execs that care more about kissing up to each other than their employees' ideas and growth. And worst of all, it's become a company that lost its identity: No longer is it about making a difference, it's about making sales so the executives can get their giant built-in bonuses. 

TOMS used to do cool things to inspire, but now all the efforts are towards sales promotions under the ""get $5 off towards changing a child's life"" guise, making new products to in industries they're completely unfamiliar with, and aggressive expansion into foreign markets.",0

Walk into work each morning and hundreds of new creative ideas have launched since the day before — you get to play a cameo role in helping them come to life. That's a pretty great feeling. 

The founders reincorporated the company as a public benefit corporation. Through that they set a number of longterm commitments that orient the team towards working for a more creative and equitable world. It can feel like a huge responsibility, but it's also incredibly motivating. 

I keep learning. Each year I look back and I had the chance to work on something that pushed me out of my comfort zone. And there's a whole culture learning from one another. Many colleagues devote time to teaching in-house courses. And the education stipend is flexible and an invitation to push yourself in new directions.

Mean, selfish, ignorant, arrogant, and bullying management play favorites + diminish shortcomings + violations of those they like but over-emphasize missteps + ""write up"" those they don't like. They know to avoid lawsuits (because there have been some), so they're covert in building a case against you if they want you gone. They talk behind your back and are clique-ish.

Aesop is based purely on image, attempting to convey culture and class through a narrow prism of what they define as being good 'taste'. The grossly conservative attitudes, unbridled (and unwarranted) attitudes of superiority, and general lack of humanity on a managerial level have led me to actively dissuade those seeking employment from looking here, particularly if they have any kind of genuine creative talent. It will be swallowed and regurgitated as some sick iteration of Aesop's 'values', and then  turned into a meek, capitalist attempt to sell some overpriced handbalm.",0

Staff are worked to death for little pay with no hope of a pay rise or any appreciation for going above and beyond and any concerns you have are just ignored completely. Certain members of management are great and probably understand but seem to have their hands tied. High staff turnover and massive overuse of agency temps, half of which just show up to steal as much beer as they can.

They come up with campaigns such as 50/50 profit share to make customers believe employees are receiving something instead of raising wages, when in fact all I have seen from this is £1.30 in an entire year. This company does not care about you, all they care about is making a profit in any way they can. They are no better than any other corporate pub and will exploit you nonetheless.",0

- There is a constant inability to get out of our own way that's become almost a toxic mindset at this point.

You can feel the pressure that Bain, having acquired half the company, pushes to meet these sales goals. I know from speaking to many employees in different parts of the company that the culture is starting to lag and people are slowly burning out. The cycle of bringing in outside companies to try to reinvigorate the brand and failing to do so is tiresome and has not progressed in the years I’ve been here. Giving is at the heart for most employees, but I just don’t see that currently reflected in the brand. I expect more imminent layoffs and don’t see a clear future for TOMS.",0

"If you work in any of the retail spaces expect to feel continuously undervalued, unheard and nervous. The internal culture has shifted since its origins with the head office staff implementing a discriminatory hierarchy headed by the arrogant UK manager. During my time with the company I was paid thousands less for the same role as male or Australian colleagues who had identical positions and responsibilities. HR are unapproachable and reluctant to give any meaningful help with sporadic and bias responses if you do gain a reply. Some working in HQ have gotten there through connections or nationality and not merit meaning they have no real understanding of how the store spaces operate. Same goes for the global team with a lot of nepotism occurring. Unrealistic standards are set without the correct financial benefits that you would expect from a high end retail company. If you raise an issue professionally and coherently you are labeled a trouble maker and ostracized further from your peers within the clique they’ve manufactured. A lot of effort is funneled into keeping up appearances that the company is full of creativity, consideration and opportunity. The only value that Aesop does truly care about is monetary with a huge focus on profit and KPI’s. Believe the other negative reviews that have listed, in detail their personal experiences as the shorter, positive feed back here has been encouraged. The humanity of the employees is constantly disregarded and we are expected to behave like manicured robots. During manager meetings it was common for consultants and part time staff to be discussed in insensitive and derogatory manners and even ridiculed. A unhealthy and gossiping elite in upper management kept many in a state of anxiety. It was openly encouraged to delegate duties outside of an employees retail responsibilities to save on hiring extra staff or assistant managers leaving many overwhelmed and feeling bitter. Penny pinching where possible to maximise profits at the detriment to those working in the stores whilst spending seems unlimited for those working in the head office with lavish lunches and planned activities. The large London team was not at all reflective of the demographic of the capital. Preferential treatment always shown towards Australian nationals as mentioned in many other reviews.",0

Becoming like most greedy corporations. The amount of micro managing is deplorable. Making you feel like they do not trust you to do your job or that you’re incapable of doing it without them holding your hand. Had to do a lot of over communicating of task such as floorsets that we didn’t used to do which makes it feel like they don’t trust your judgement or even trust that you’re completing task. At time’s you will work with people that have an almost cult like mentality for the company. Changed benefits recently with a higher deductible; insurance is mediocre. You have to hold onto bad employees way too long because it’s nearly impossible to get fired unless you have multiple infractions within a specific amount of time. Adopted a performance based scheduling system that doesn’t allow you to give every associate a decent amount/promised upon hiring amount of hours. Basically a system that forces them to get other jobs or quit a job they enjoy because they’re not making enough money. Upper management outside of your store is not very supportive; may be different in other districts just not mine. The DM was really hard to get ahold of and very unprofessional at times. For example the store manager that left before I did was a fantastic manager; which is hard to come by; and they left for all of the same they're a. They brought our stores volume up by almost a million dollars and our store ranked as one of the top ten in the company for awhile which was basically ignored towards the end. And in the time leading up to their departure they were made out to be an incompetent outcast because the voiced their opinions. After they left our DM gossiped about them and their performance to the remaining management staff which is extremely unprofessional. Work and life balance is very challenging at times. Made to cut a lot of labor almost every week; some weeks worse than others. I’ve seen over forty hours get cut making it impossible to give even outstanding employees shifts. And when you’re made to cut that many hours and schedule so lightly that there’s not adequate coverage it puts twice the work load on the couple people that are there making even typically slow days feel incredibly stressful and chaotic. Heavy schedule monitoring and will not let you schedule after hours task in a way that works best for your store or your team. Used to have really good contests with incentives for staff and management but have changed them so heavily that it’s basically impossible for lower volume stores or stores located in smaller areas to win. Monitors social media and you can be terminated for things posted. Once Paul Van Doren sadly passed away the company completely changed. They threw all of his values out the window and became just like every other grubby corporation out there. Constant price increases and not a lot of change in quality. They say they're a people company that sells shoes; while that initially seemed to be the case it has completely changed. They show no care or appreciation for their management team or teams in general. Everyone I know that’s worked there or currently works there says the same thing and even the new store manager that was there as I left is now leaving. They have and are losing a lot of good employees because of the drastic change in how they’re running the businesses.,0

2. Other coworkers I interact with every day are constantly thinking about other people. It is not just leadership. In particular, because I witness this firsthand, I'll call out the directors and managers who have Slack conversations or meeting topics that include things like: how to support and lift up junior developers who are having trouble learning a particular skill, how to promote diversity and reduce bias during the interview process, how to support members of the product team that have too much on their plate, and many many more.

3. The engineering team is full of passionate, highly intelligent developers. I'm very impressed by all the folks I have interacted with, particularly the senior developers who have a *ton* of knowledge to share and/or collaborate, and so much willingness to do so.

"Something is amiss at Brewdog USA. Within a few days of my initial training, it was abundantly clear that very few people within the organization were qualified for the positions to which they had been appointed. The most forgiving explanation for this is that the company is absurdly cheap and doesn’t want to pay any skilled people with experience. Case in point: this is the second largest brewery in Central Ohio, behind only Anheuser-Busch, with over 50,000 square feet. The refrigerated storage warehouse lies on the complete opposite end of the facility to the bar. However, Brewdog USA did not, at the time of this writing, own a single forklift or employ even one forklift operator. Why? Because that is a skilled position requiring a certified/licensed operator, and would screw with the bottomline (which seems to be to make as much money as cheaply as possible), regardless of impact on or safety of employees/customers. So bartenders have to drag a pallet jack clear across this gargantuan warehouse, load it with kegs, and then haul them back by hand and foot. It is preposterous. 

On the more sinister side of the coin, Brewdog is willfully negligent. There is plenty of evidence to support this take. In my time with the company, numerous employees consistently reported countless safety concerns. Within all areas of the organization: production, office, “retail” (bars). All went ignored. At all levels within the organization. It is unclear whether the inexperienced office and management staff are just taking marching orders from Brewdog UK and are powerless to act, or whether they just don’t give a damn as long as their own coffers are getting filled. 

Brewdog has been blasted for their attempts to honor women, in particular their “Pink IPA” beer, which was just re-branded Punk IPA with a girly name, color and theme. The backlash to that effort also pointed out that there weren’t enough females within the organization. I found this to be untrue. The company, at least stateside, was predominantly female, outside of the production crew. But is this because the company is forward-thinking, or because they can pay young females way less than they can men of equivalent age? 

Additionally, they claim to support the Living Wage Pledge, that is, to pay their employees a living wage, which numerous sources, statisticians, data scientists, etc., have proven to be around $15/hr pretty much everywhere in the country. However, Brewdog pays the standard wage to bartenders, servers and kitchen staff. They use rigged metrics to suggest these wages are living wages. If you are paying the same rate as every other place, you aren't paying a living wage. Quit lying. 

Despite a lot of talk about employees being “family” and turnover being “low”/”non existent”, handfuls of people were outright fired during my tenure, some with little justifiable reason, and scores of others quit because the conditions were so unsatisfactory and unacceptable, myself included. One particular firing was one of a handful of individuals within the organization who had any actual experience in their position. This individual was the only true professional present. Their dismissal signaled very bad things to come. Since my departure, I have run into a number of other individuals who either left the company due to the abysmal working conditions, or who had partners that did. It’s common for restaurant managers to have to put in long, unrewarding hours, but the GMs at Brewdog may as well live in the restaurants, stripped from their families to ensure the ship doesn’t sink. (Make no mistake, Brewdog is actually a restaurant chain, not a legitimate brewery. The on-site breweries are merely a means to an end - a loophole so the company can self-distribute its beers and avoid the US 3-tiered distribution system wherever possible.) 

The company spouts off about corporate buyouts and breweries “selling out”, but last year sold a 22% stake in the company for ~$230M to the owner of Pabst. There is simply nothing “punk” about this organization. They do love to use that as an excuse for their terrible business practices though, like cobbling passingly safe structures together at the last minute, letting customers into live construction sites to turn a profit on an unfinished product. In 2018, how does a business open up without being ADA compliant? Is that even legal? I’m not sure, but Brewdog isn’t. Not at any of its locations, as far as I can tell. They love to brag about their rooftop at their Franklinton, Columbus location. Unfortunately no one with a physical disability will ever be able to enjoy it. See, Brewdog was unwilling to spend the money required to outfit the building properly, something other, smaller breweries in the region have done and continue to do.  

Long story short, when you get a deep inside look at this organization, something is clearly off, and you get the unnerving sense that it’s a sham, a scam, and a fraud. Their mission, repeated ad nauseum, is to “make people as passionate about craft beer as (they) are”. It is evident that the only thing they are more passionate about is money.",0

There is obvious favoritism, substance abuse issues, and overall problematic management. The managers don't take care of their best employees which drives them away. The menu is top often dictated by the owner rather than the chef. This leads to having dishes on each station that either require unrealistic prep times/amounts, or impossible function on the station. There needs to be 1 dish taken off of every station so that the work load for each person is manageable. The last day I worked we sold almost $100,000 in beer and food. With an average price point of around $11 thats a lot of food and beer. It's insane. I really could go on and on. The job was so great in so many ways.

Proudly flaunt that staff are paid Living Wage, but then proceed to heavily restrict wage percentage - £10+ an hour starting wage for bar staff sounds great, but if full-time staff only get 28 hours a week, what's the point? (Salaried staff are paid a mostly fair wage, however.)

Unhealthy work culture. Managers are expected to always be on call and constantly 'take one for the team' by working shifts alone or with insufficient staff, and expected to cover for absences and staff shortages without and kind of compensation.

Marketing and events teams are completely clueless and a constant source of frustration for the people 'on the ground'.

Expectations are ridiculously high from employees and they pay pretty much the same as other retailers for a sales associates. I’ve given so much from my life to being successful at my job.

"I've worked at >5 companies in Silicon Valley including Google, and Coursera is my favorite by far. Here's why:

1) Coursera is not too big and not too small. At ~300 people, the company is in the ""goldilocks zone,"" size-wise. It's not so big that you feel insulated from the market and like a cog in a big machine. It's not so small that you have to wear lots of different functional hats and you lack the functional support that you need to do your primary role well. At Coursera, you have good cross-functional support, you know all/most of your colleagues, and you can stay close to customers, learners, etc.

2) Coursera is a mission-driven organization. All/most people who are here wouldn't be here if they didn't have a strong sense of urgency about the transformative role that high quality, accessible education/learning can have for the world. This attitude manifests in objective discussions and debates that are focused on determine the right course of action to accomplish the mission vs. ego-driven discussions about people's subjective opinions. People do have opinions, but they take a back seat to facts and alignment around those facts.

3) Coursera is a super inclusive organization. True openness to hearing everyone's ideas and taking them into consideration is somewhat rare in Silicon Valley. Executives often pay lip service to inclusivity regardless of level, quite often focusing on promoting their own agenda and perspectives. At Coursera, the executive team genuinely seeks employees' perspectives and opinions. Ultimately they can't make decisions that everyone is happy with, but they generally seek to understand diverse perspectives before making a final decision. Sometimes decisions get re-opened and re-examined in response to people's considerations, which I think is healthy but can be a little frustrating sometimes as well.",1

"- Management cares more about being cool than about sorting out real problems in the pub. Good vibes and cool outfits are not gonna fix that leaking pipe, guys.

- In the branch where I worked, there were issues such as harassment or people drinking alcohol on work hours that were well known by everybody and no manager moved a finger to solve them. They were pretty serious issues that contributed to creating a really bad environment.

- If the pub was full and you wanted to rest during your break, your only option was to sit on the floor, on the tiny space available between the office and the bin bags from the kitchen. Now imagine if you have decided to use your break to eat something.

So no, this is not a good place to build a career if that is what you are looking for.

- Brewdog is very proud of its Unicorn Fund (where they share 10% of the benefits with their employees). This would be amazing if it wasn't because somehow, they have their ways to avoid to pay it. The venue where I worked used to make 30k easily, in a normal/busy day, the Christmas period was a huge boost for the sales and we knew that the pub didn´t pay any rent... However, nobody received any benefits at all. Nobody was informed about this situation in advance and, when asked about it, the management team avoided the subject. It might be true that there were no benefits, but the way it all was managed was dark, and the lack of information and communication, really frustrating.

- Every payday someone was missing hours. In some moment it became normal to have newbies that were missing payslips until 1-1.5 months after they started working and nobody seemed to care much along the management team.

In general, I think Brewdog has a good will to make things differently, and the values they defend as a company are great, but in the particular case of the venue where I worked it all got lost somewhere on the way.",0

One day my first week I was called in which is no big deal but she basically just stated it instead of asking me. Also I’m not a huge fan of using WhatsApp and they will watch the security cameras and post pictures of you doing work in a group text to everyone. They would either praise a hard worker or say “don’t be like this” I think watching the security camera at home and then calling for literally any discrepancy shows how insecure and controlling they are. They called when they saw something and that slowed down productivity a lot.,0

"The 2017 Best Places to Work announcement just went out, and when perusing the list, the only thing I kept thinking was that in fact, Kickstarter is a better place to work than any of the places on the list. Its true. Here are just 5 reasons why:

(1) This morning I walked in and my coworkers were gathered in the kitchen, listening to music and preparing a pancake breakfast for the rest of the staff. Just because. Also: This is not an atypical morning.

(2) Yesterday we had Dyson Airblade hand-dryers installed to help diminish our negative impact on the environment. There is currently a coat drive being organized by our operations team, and our annual holiday gifting event includes a charity component. These features are just few of many many more because Kickstarter is a public benefit corporation, and for us our bottom line is measure by our impact on society. Read more here: kickstarter.com/charter

(3) Its the end of the year so many folks are discussing how they spent their health and wellness stipends. Here's a list of things folks have told me: Ceramics classes, French and Spanish classes, Cooking classes, new musical instruments, museum memberships, attending professional conferences, buying books. On the wellness front folks have put money towards gym memberships, physical therapy, and yoga classes. A bunch of folks even tried out Soul Cycle together.

(4) Today is a Healthy Workplace Workshop, and earlier this year we had workshops on being an ally, public speaking and management. Many of us also have company sponsored management coaches.

(5) The building we work in is exceptional. It was build from green and healthy materials, and designed to be a place that people would love to be and could access for work or other creative endeavors 24/7. In addition to all the cooking mentioned above, we host a regular D&D game (and have a huge games library in our actual library), staff led film festivals and screenings, an annual musical recital and maker nights.",1

"Overall lack of professionalism, experience and transparency.  The unfortunate aspect in all this is that the company did have a bright future, but they simply can not plan and execute in an efficient manner.  This is apparent in many areas, especially in Sales.  There is no CEO and essentially no leader.  There are too many executives who are asking others how to do their jobs.  

Middle management attempts to lead with no direction. This creates mass confusion and inefficiency for their employees.

I'll give them credit for knowing they are weak in these areas, however, they should be prepared for the feedback they receive when hiring professionals to help move the company forward.

Many managers and executives do not have the experience necessary to guide this company to the right place.  How could they when they are so focused on popularity contests? Many of them work together to push others out who speak the truth.  If you didn't realize that you are replaceable before, you will at TOMS.  Guaranteed.

"Not much pay $20/hr, No room to grow there is a 100+ other TA’s waiting to replace you and take your shift. Meaning you won’t be considered for a raise. And your colleagues will be so desperate for sub work they will create slack bots to claim shifts the second they get posted. I’m After your cohort ends it will be several months before you are reassigned. I haven’t had a paycheck in 3 months due to not being reassigned. The curriculum we teach is weak and we are told to lie to students saying if they graduate the boot camp they will get a job in tech as a software engineer making lots of money. In reality most these places that are hiring are looking for at least 4 years of experience + a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science to get considered for an entry level position. It’s very rare for a student to get a job in tech right away. It normally takes out to about a year for them to be hired. Meanwhile they have to pay price of the bootcamp while they struggle to find a job. The cohort I worked on the instructor said some racist comments about a student in the break room that “she’s the most basic white girl b**ch can’t get s**t done” in regards to a failing student that wasn’t going to graduate.

"Extremely poor senior leadership.
Insistence on wasting a lot of time and money on bizarre publicity stunts. We never hear about how well they do weirdly enough (no guys, retweets don't count).
Updates from senior leadership are awful. The internal marketing is somehow more embarrassing than the external marketing. Sometimes I wonder if they think David Brent is a role model. The internal updates and all hands are shocking.
Bullying and blame culture throughout business. It's not uncommon for people to be here one day and gone the next. We don't get updated about changes either. Teammates are then expected to pick up the workload, with no recompense, training etc.
No structure to anything. Everyone runs around not knowing what's going on most of the time and doing everything last minute. 
No career development, training or progression. If you're a yes man, if your face fits, that's where you'll get ahead. Doesn't matter that you're not actually any good at your job.
Good luck if you've got a complaint for HR - they're not interested.
Unicorn fund and general compensation is so far below average and what other companies offer - you should 'feel privileged' to work at BrewDog.
Quality of beer steadily declining over the years
Culture hasn't progressed beyond a punchy startup, despite boasting of success and improvements. Lots of cutting corners and last minute projects and major changes. 

All of the problems arise from one person and one person only. An absolutely toxic leader who lacks business insight, but for some reason micro manages every aspect of the company. Trusted senior leadership are those that have been around a while, and don't know any better to push back (and lacking in basic business knowledge as well, so they always just say yes). All the new senior hires that we brag about stealing from other big companies go within a few months anyway because their face doesn't fit. There's a proper old guard here resting on their laurels. If EFPs (or TSG for that matter) saw the numbers behind some of the stuff that went on, they'd probably reconsider their investment. This business is so weirdly inefficient but nobody admits it. Good exposure from the PR though.",0

Upper management favored the boutiques with higher revenues and didn't think twice about the slower ones. A good chunk of the employees eventually drink the artsy/ minimalist Kool Aid and become clique-ish and even borderline cultish (classically retail behavior I guess). Some will deem you a threat if you fight for a Full Time/ Store Manager position. I had a few co-workers that tried their hardest to join these ranks, fight for a higher position, become total robots for the company only to get denied- leaving them feeling burned in the end. Some of the managers are painfully humorless, stiff, and unyielding. Don't be surprised if you get side-eyed by some of them if you're more extroverted in your demeanor, laugh freely with customers, or have a strong opinion on anything. Frankly, keep your personal life to yourself and be tactful of what you share with others. If not, the information will circulate and eventually find it's way back to you (again, classically retail behavior).",0

"The company has grown way more hierarchical over time as the number of employees has grown, and decision-making has dramatically worsened as a result. Middle-management has a real difficulty translating C-level strategy into meaningful action plans.
The company loves a reorganization. I had 5 managers in 5 years, with 3 reorganizations of my group, the last of which reverted back to the original structure.
The need to report to the stock market has serious consequences in some units, particularly those who work with universities as they do not know or understand the need to work in quarters. It has made team morale suffer as middle management pressures ICs to meet arbitrary deadlines.
Promotions and advancement are difficult. There are a lot of talented folks who've achieved a lot in their time at the company and have no place to go, nor any manager really championing their development. It's a serious flaw, and one that had a lot of our team considering whether they wanted to be at Coursera in one year's time, let alone 3.
Remote-first work has meant that individuals can quickly feel siloed. Our leaders meet regularly, but teams do not.",0
I was able to have lots of interpersonal communication,1
"Aesop can be very particular about certain things and do not explain why. For example, they require all managers to have the same days off every week (Sunday monday) and this can cause some scheduling issues if you have a small staff and want a Sunday or monday off.

"Indiegogo has ultimately been a flexible and positive work experience for me. The company is beyond understanding with work / life balance with generous paid time off and work from home policies.

Though its been around for a few years, it still very much embraces the scrappy start up mentality. 

Office space is huge with plenty of room for everyone. Multi level space in SoMa. 

Quarterly all hands activities are key for company bonding and it seems like Indiegogo has recently been re-investing in them which has led to a fun company culture.

"+ False sense of comradery- Do not be fooled by the ""friendship"" act that is put on. Company-wide there is a false portrayal of everyone having each other's backs.  

+ Not a single person of color in high leadership positions which, in 2018, they should be quite embarrassed by

+ No opportunity for growth within the company which will become apparent within the first 2-3 months upon being hired

+ Highly unorganized company. Severe lack of communication between management and in-store staff. Management seems to be stretched out beyond their means. 

+ Sales approach is the oddest I have ever encountered. As mentioned in another review- “ They will train you to sound like a robot, then become upset with you for sounding like a robot.”

+ Managerial staff is highly manipulative and racist

+ Weird communication via email (there is an odd cult-like format that they force you to communicate in— it feels really robotic, pretentious, unnatural, and just outright… strange…

+ Terribly fake and pretentious company-wide attitude: Two-faced employees, management team, and higher-ups which is cause for a lot of unnecessary anxiety 

+ Products are touted as high-grade skin care. These are petroleum based/ mostly synthetic ingredients that make up the Aesop line.

Leadership is generally aligned and clear on their visions, and take the time to ensure visibility and clear communication with strategies, business metrics, and shifting priorities.

Also expect to be comfortable demonstrating on their hands via washing, moisturizing, perfuming, etc. You are constantly on your feet—depends on manager perhaps—and the brand preaches about not being about the sale; yet that is truly what they care about—sales and customer conversion.

Of course you get a nice holiday allowance and free product but that doesn't count for much when you have to see a councillor because of the stress, and a hospital doctor because work affects your health. There's no support either - senior management, HR and even the ethics committee turn their backs if they need to cover for friends in high places or if it becomes too much like hard work.

Have lately seen the trend of hiring diverse candidates then putting them in an inhospitable environment. Their inability to thrive is viewed as their problem, not a problem with the organisational culture or management. I worry this is then used as an argument not to hire for diversity.

"Started off the job thinking I was helping people with their skin. We used fancy tools to measure the water and oil content of people's skin in order to recommend products that would help them. As someone with past skincare problems I wanted to help people gain their confidence back. However, the company is way more focused on how much you sell rather than how much you're helping the customer. We were told to push customers to buy more even if it wasn't in their budget, sell them the bigger sizes even though they hadn't even tried it yet and wouldn't know how it affected their skin. Bonuses are given out based on how much the store made over their monthly goal, which was usually extremely unrealistic. I worked there for almost 2 years and only ever got a bonus once.

Pros: free products a few times per year, online store for employees with discounted products, pretty high pay for a part time retail job",1

"Aesop is a company that has profited off marketed themselves as a socially-minded/progressive/ethical business. Aesop has previously made large internal and external statements about local and global events, yet they have been silent on the issue of Israel's attacks on Palestine. 
Customers love to shop at a trendy brand that they think aligns with their values and Aesop uses this as a marketing tool. They've made statements on The Voice to Parliament, Black Lives Matter, Invasion Day and LGBTQIA+ issues. However, these gestures are meaningless when they have connections to a country committing war crimes/genocide (Israel) and generally won't make any statements of solidarity with Palestine. This is likely because they are more concerned with profit loss than human rights.
Staff across Aesop asked senior management for more clarity about Aesop/L'Oreal's connections with, and business dealings with Israel and no explanation was given. 
No number of perks and benefits can make up for that.
+ Yes, it is like a cult. They've been known to ask certain staff members to change their accent/voice to sound more 'Aesop' - the way they hire for a culture fit is very classist.

I was paid $7.25 (minimum wage) for the whole 3 years and I had A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES. I was not only a scooper, but Ben and Jerry's in Puerto Rico also has a restaurant so we had to cook food, be a waiter, clean, be a cashier AND scoop ice cream all at once.",0

First year of working at the bar staff had put on 25% under their contracts for months to cover the managers costs and to keep his bonus and lied too.

Higher management encourages  staff to report each other for promotions that are not available, treat staff like children, victimise themselves to cover their backs, and advise managers to make the work place so uncomfortable for individuals to leave by playing on their mental health and lack of experience  aka bullying if they cant afford the roll. 
If you ever report anything to HR about higher management you would have painted a target on you back. As nothing is kept privet in brewdog.

Your expected to be a chef on top of a bartender, customer host and your own manager all at the same time for half the wage and then again in trouble if you can't do all task that is demanded. 

I've seen a general manager bully a staff member because they were jealous and threatened as they had been in the company longer, they made it very clear to the rest of the staff in front of customers too. 
The  area manager would blame the managers for there mental brakedowns and guilt them to get there way.

"Office team efforts can't be felt on the retail end - marketing efforts have seem bleak (understandably so for the brand's positioning) but it has dropped heavily over the years. Blind expansion seems to be an issue when manpower needs are not met which resulted in moderate quality of new hires. 

Senior staffs (employment wise, not position) in the company can see the difference and if customers can even feel so, it speaks at great lengths of the quality of your services. There is honestly not enough motivation besides to keep the spaces running and try not to be affected by KPI-driven culture. It isn't always a challenge and/or opportunity as the CEO responded, people join the company for the culture and if this culture is lost, on what grounds would you expect people to see changes as a way of improvement?

Lack of transparency in certain aspects of conversations where deemed possible. Manpower staffing plans are questionable in many ways (revisiting people who have already left when the company didn't offer them said role, and offering said role to that person once the previously hired person has left? Are staffs that disposable?).",0

"Company is constantly restructuring and NYC base office in constant chaos. No one knows what they are doing and people are quitting and/or being terminated at a record pace. The company took away the L’Oreal Profit Share to all retail employees, while the home office staff and District Managers were able to maintain it. The benefits get less and less each year but they expect more of you and not less. Many promotions fail because of poor planning and not listening to their stores. If you are critical of the company at all and offer suggestions, you are deemed negative. They promise quick growth but constantly skip over qualified internal candidates to hire outsiders with no relevant background, who often hold the job for less than a year. Many District Managers try to micro manage your store and make your life hell. The Planning for sales plan is done so last minute and in such random ways it makes it very hard to earn the small bonus incentives they offer. It’s really ensulting after making the company a ton of money much of the time you are offered a pizza party, snacks, or extra free Kiehls products.... which you often have to fight to get and constantly remind upper management about. The HR department is a joke and will not take you seriously and many people have had to go to L’Oreal Ethics and beyond with their issues to be resolved.

Theres an unrealistic expectation to be perfect at everything constantly whilst navigating the fall out of their advertising and promotional blunders.

"In place of an effective business strategy, clearly communicated and supported by head office, there are silly, unreasonable, ineffective expectations at store level, usually communicated in a panicked, unprofessional and contradictory manor. High level of staff turnover, 23 managers/assistant managers left in just over 3 years. I had 5 area managers and 5 HR officers over a similar period. Also at senior management level the turnover is high, meaning GM’s never build rapport, have a clear long term strategy or duty of care, as a result they fail to deal with poor operations, cultural or structural issues during their time with the brand. They seem to spend time exclusively with 8 or so middle managers in head office, most of whom are stale. This apathy and disconnect then filters down. Under industry standard for salary (-20% in my experience) and holiday (annual leave starts at 22 days), mitigated..they say when you start, by commission. This is a cynical lie as targets are unachievable (+30-60%).  Poor work/life balance, expectations of joining several watts app groups which are over used during out of office times, used in place of professional emails by area managers who are lazy and want to avoid email trails, sometimes down right illegal when it comes to professional expectations regarding communication (requesting updated weekend business plans and strategy planning at 2.30 pm on a Friday...via watts app), all raised with HR, ignored mostly by middle managers. Few yearly appraisals held, no clear communication regarding progression, especially within brands inside L’Oréal. Lip service giving to long boarding, coaching, succession planning etc. I saw next to nothing during my time, despite the large number of spreadsheets you were asked to complete. In this respect Kiehl’s feels like it is stuck in the 80’s. Expecting unpaid over time to prove you’re worthy, no respect for work life balance, “mushroom management” approach (keep them all in the dark and they’ll grow) and the blame game when things aren’t running smoothly. There is no leadership to speak of, the working environment is quite unhealthy and morale across all stores is very low.",0

"No real stability, just went through a round of layoffs and got rid of people that were posting revenue positive results. Kept a number of incompetent managers. Check Re-code for more details.

As mentioned, many managers are incompetent and just follow the newest shiny object, rather than making decisions that demonstrate actual understanding of the business and techniques to hit goals.

Worse still, there is rampant nepotism. The Stanford mafia is real!
Read the experience of executive staff and one level down, it will quickly become clear that many are not qualified for the positions they occupy.

There are essentially no promotions and those who are promoted receive that recognition because of relationships, not performance.

The new CEO, Jeff Maggioncalda, has run 1 company before Coursera, not a great choice for this growth company. Additionally, he laid off 15% of the company, not based on performance, even though $60M was just raised. Does he even have a heart?

It's so rewarding when you work at a place where everyone, I mean everyone, around you truly wants to make this world a better place. That means that we naturally have people with big hearts that work here. The people you meet here end up being life-long friends because you already have one of the most important things in common - values.",1

The quest for equity means that they can’t afford to invest in you. They don’t want brewers, just low budget operators.",0
"- Since the re org, middle managers have resources cut to a ridiculous level, they will use the most ridiculous  reason not to give you a raise or comp adjustment like ""you eat too much snacks is unprofessional"" or ""client find your voice irritating"" and not give a raise because of it even if you had performed better than anyone on your team.
-on enterprise, leadership is more worried about their weekend plans than recognizing or leading their team, they will take credit on employees back with no shame. 
-It doesn't matter if you work harder or smarter than everyone else is, if you do not come from a top university forget about recognition, raises or bonuses. (completely against the values)
-Salaries ar not even close to be competitive, the new bonus process is a joke.
- they will promise you a raise if you deliver OKRs and deliver ambitious projects, once you deliver they will use the worst excuses to not give you the raise they promised, and take the credit for it.
-with everyone quitting they will give you more work and promise you a raise or promotion, but at the end again will not happen, all a lie so you do not leave, and if you exceed your goals, forget about recognition, they will take credit for it.
- It will be 3 years soon, i got ""promoted "" but no compensation raise, I still have the same salary since i started, I brought it up to my manager,  3 years same salary is unacceptable, i have successfully delivered all my our in the last 3 years, still no raise, I have completed the projects and extra projects, still no raise,  3 years same salary and i only get excuses, ""the new promotion process has changed"" , "" with the re org i manage not to reduce your salary and have a (ridiculous) bonus for you!"" ,  they will tell you the salary is more than faire, and show them that the competition is paying 30 % better, they will not even reply and change the subject. 
- a new teammate with a lower level has the same salary than you, they are unable to provide a reason. Other than ""you should not have that information"".
- there is 2 kind of people here: the hard worker, takes the values seriously and the lazy one that takes credit for everything and keep lying to you until you burnt out, you are replaceable anyways if not you they will find someone else they can keep working hard until they figure out they have been played or burnout, in the mean time they will take credit from you and your hard work.

"If you’re serious about design, advancing your craft and career, then beware: Indiegogo is a dead end.

Management possesses zero experience in branding, below-mediocre design competence, and enables an uninspired mindset in designers to make haste—because of poor project management—rather than positioning them to create with intentionality, polish, and efficiency. The design team thus lacks a structure for success: no vision, no design system, no pixel school and is given inept hands-on design direction. The result is clunky UX, incohesive (and comical) art direction, and poor execution of craft throughout—basically, work that’s not to be proud of. And for a critical touchpoint to IGG's brand development, its design presents a deaf ear to resonating with users for what should be a space that honors their ideas, dreams, causes, investment, and community-thinking.

The designers here are at unfortunate risk, not only handicapped from doing good work and advancing their skills but from growing their careers and earnings—their livelihoods, after all. Better days are promised, but that rhetoric is never convincing. Time is limited and being wasted; the competition will not wait for management to all of a sudden become adept at design and branding (and nor should the designers expect to continue waiting). And that possibility is pointless anyway, because strong design management is not built from giving authority and responsibility to unskilled people. So, what to do?",0

Senior leadership is going in multiple directions and comes across as more interested in hitting numbers to make their bonus then in serving people well (both through TOMS giving and to TOMS own employees).

A couple months ago they had a large layoff due to low sales.  Instead of holding senior leadership accountable, they laid-off some of the most experienced employees.  They also laid off a number of the oldest employees - the ones who sacrificed to actually build the brand and didn't come for the money.  It was at this moment where those of us left realized we could all be easily tossed aside.  Dozens of experienced people have left since then and most of the rest of us are looking.

"- Big picture communication can be a challenge, just like at many organizations. 
- Some upper level management doesn't have management or team leadership experience, which creates poor leaders at the top. Fortunately there are a lot of smart people at the bottom who will eventually take over these spots. 
- Some upper management plays favorites and doesn't take the time to get to know all the employees on their teams or understand their background, which can be frustrating. An upper level manager shouldn't be in the weeds, they should train people to be in the weeds for them and have a big picture view of their department, fostering and mentoring each team member to give peak performance.",0

In the whole time working there, I can't remember having time to have even a brief non-work chat with anyone on shift to make any friends. Obviously very high staff turnover as a result.

"- Company is partnerships driven. If partners don't wont something, its not going to happen. Coursera has essentially not innovated in the last two years because its partners don't want any change.

- Lots of incompetent middle managers.
- There is no meritocracy. Bad, bad place to work if you expect that your hard work will be rewarded. It will not. Even though you will hit amazing results, you will get no rewards. There are several bad managers who haven't gotten one good result in a loong time and they are still there.",0
"No benefits (medical, dental, paid vacation) for team except Manager and Assistant Manager",0
A little bit low pay,0
Below average compensation and no benefits despite full-time hours. Little respect for personal and professional boundaries. No raises until after the first full year! New expectations were added every month it felt with nothing to show for it but props. Bonuses were virtually unachievable as the numbers were totally unrealistic for the changing economy. The technology was constantly breaking and tickets for the same things had to be placed several times a month. IT would launch programs before they were fully operational and the staff just had to figure it out.,0
- Macroeconomic headwinds have impacted the business - Some business lines have weaker leadership than others - Some American bias as the company is still early in its global expansion,0
the company is going downhill and we’re throwing discounts rapidly and it’s not going well. the management is becoming more and more nitpicky on what you wear and how you sell and how everything is. i used to love coming into work and now it is a nightmare and i despise going to work. if you’re new and only know it for how it is now i suppose it could be fun. but not for older employees.,0

"This was one of the most toxic environments I had ever worked in. I was bullied by my manager, constantly criticized to the point where he made me draft emails and have him read and correct them before I was allowed to send them out. Not only was there an overall dread of losing your job because there were several layoffs and VPs and Directors constantly quitting, but there was no collaboration between teams. My manager made comments to me that were racist and sexist. I had filed a formal complaint to HR but they did not do anything about it other than let me know that my manager would undergo training. Because of this job, I had severe anxiety and depression and had to seek professional help. My self esteem declined drastically during this role due to the micro-management and toxicity and I felt that I couldn’t do anything right.",0

We may disagree on the right focus areas or paths to take, but I've never felt like a coworker was acting selfishly or in bad faith.  The sense of shared purpose is great, and working with such smart people keeps me sharp and encourages me to learn and be better.",1

It's also a little difficult to advance within the company, but that may also change with the purchase.",0
I think the pay raises are low.,0
"Unfortunately, there is a pervasive cultural divide between senior management and the employees. I believe the senior management was responding to pressure from the board, but the outcome was that there was constant discussion about ""sustainability"", which is an unnecessary euphemism for ""profit"". The executive management believed that the employees wouldn't tolerate working on things that would make edX make money. I don't know if that was true about anyone (it wasn't true about me), but the real problem is how they dealt with it: they *lied*.

edX's mission is to ""increase access to high-quality education for everyone, everywhere"", but employees at edX aren't allowed to work on projects that would increase access for people that have slow or unreliable internet connections. We were constantly pushed to work on projects at the behest of large corporate or government donors.

At the same time, the employees aren't valued and the organization is inefficient and misdirected. When employees reported dissatisfaction with their jobs in a review last year, the management responded in an unbelievably corporate way: they created a committee.

The committee reported its findings to Wendy Cebula (the COO and President). When she was told that employees felt that employee retention was not a priority to executive management she said, ""they're right. When someone leaves edX, I see it as an opportunity to get an A-player in here.""

The tragedy is that many of edX's employees are talented people who really do care about the stated mission and have made personal sacrifices to be there. My sincerest wish is that the organization is put under more sincere management and edX can have the impact that we hope for.

If you (as edX's president) feel that you have to hit some deadline for a donor, how about just saying that instead of couching it in a fantasy about helping the world by starting with the people that (frankly) don't really need the help?",0

Large amount of mediocre people promoted to unnecessary job functions. Leadership is not receptive to innovation or new ideas;  they keep doing the same thing year after year expecting different result, even as revenue continues to drop. TOMS creates a false atmosphere of ""openness"" by having numerous all-staffs and suggestion boxes to encourage employees to share ideas, however no action is ever taken to implement feedback. Huge amount of bureaucracy doesn't allow for innovation.",0

Having been through this at a previous startup, it takes a while to move on past this, but I am optimistic we'll be able to move on and be even better and more profitable than before. 

One of our core company values is deep honestly. So, with deep honesty I'll say, we had an awful performance cycle at the beginning of the year.  Fortunately, people acknowledge this, we've been able to talk about this openly, and management is in the process of fixing it. 

This is the reason I give Coursera 5 stars. It's the willingness to admit mistakes and learn from them that I respect the most.",0

"A few years ago, I asked myself whether I would regret later if I joined Coursera, and the answer was ""No!"". So I joined. A few years later, I moved on, and here is the review of the company: 

There were happy and tough times, wins and loses, just like any other startups in Bay area. As a career seeker, the main problem you need to figure out is what you want to develop in the next few years. If Coursera provides something you really want to develop or gain experience on, you should give it a try. If it doesn't provide the environment and/or opportunity, to leave without a grudge is always an option.

1) One of the best education companies which can change the world and impact lots of people.

2) Many opportunities if you really believe online learning will be the future of learning. 

3) Interesting problems to address, including both technical and non-technical issues across multiple domains including business, education, technology, etc.

4) Many talented people are still at Coursera and I would recommend everyone to work with them.",1

"The market I worked in was a toxic one. Managers and Regional Manager were toxic and complicit in addressing bad behavior. Preferential treatment of certain consultants was present and grievances were subdued with a verbal salting. Micro aggressions were rampant.

Many upper level employees have been with Kiehl's for 10+ years. This job will be what you make of it. It can be intense as you are expected to actively sell and not just be a cashier.  if your store does well you can bonus every quarter between $400-2500 depending on your position.

"Also, this is an edited version of the original review. Of course Indiegogo had it flagged and then immediately asked someone to write a positive review to bury this. Another example of shady and political moves vs focusing on fixing the business.

**second time Indiegogo has had this flagged for editing. So hiding the truth seems to be a full time job now.

Well here it is again, edited to meet Glassdoors community guidelines ;)

With the pros out of the way, we can get started on the issues that make Indiegogo a worrisome place to work, especially if you've been misinformed about the financial situation, cash flow, burn rates, stock value, and even the decision-making process of upper management.

Overall management and leadership is lacking, unethical and more closely resembles an entourage of old friends and colleagues who have nowhere else to go.

The whole company is lacking the properly experienced management and general direction of a organization thats going to survive their limited runway. Sales goals and quotas are created to simply pressure the teams into keeping things afloat. It seems more and more that revenue focused groups in the company are taking credit for any and every campaign that brings in any kind of money. 

The entire organization is floundering to survive in an ever shrinking crowdfunding market. Funding is drying up and its doubtful that any investor is willing to sink any more money into an org that hasnt been profitable in almost 10 years. 

How can Indiegogo properly project growth, revenue, and devise a strategy when the financial and overall business data is simply wrong. This is just a matter of bad work by inexperienced leaders hired by inexperienced leaders. A players don't hire B players...B players hire C players. Is that the saying? 

With the recent state of affairs in Silicon Valley and the emphasis on how an organization protects its leaders from their own incompetence, this is important to note. What ever function hired to do so, is the same that finds way to bring in friends, fire experts and ultimately erase glassdoor reviews. 

Have anyone mentioned the reviewer witch hunts that happened not 6 months ago when management spent time questioning employees about negative reviews?

The way the company operates is exactly what most people in silicon valley have been complaining about. Certain functions in the company act as the smiling faces and carefully chosen words that stand between upper management and responsibility. If someone at the top wants to fire someone because the expert didn't agree with their strategy, an internal team will come up with some BS excuse. 

The fact of the matter is that the leaders at Indiegogo have probably spent more time telling ""alt facts"" than most. But then again, those ""alt facts"" are really there to protect inexperienced managers and pressured execs to find scape-goats for overall company performance.

It's no wonder the company is not only bleeding money, it's bleeding employees. The attrition rate is worse than any company I've experienced in Silicon Valley.

Employees are demoralized, bored, and simply tired of under performing quarter over quarter. Management continues to lead the company in singing Kumbaya, while someone else tries to avert eyes from the data that matters. As much as I prefer not to quote Trump, this is a fitting circumstance.

""It's fake news...very fake news""",0

"Don't work in digital here unless you want to get screamed at, gaslit, and treated like garbage. There's some other reviews on here that are pretty accurate. Antiquated software architecture.

The product team micro-manage the development team and if you question them they'll put you on a PIP. It's terrible. The old CTO and head of engineering have left along with multiple others - 5 very senior people in the last year. Nothing here makes sense. Other functions are great, but avoid digital.

"I honestly don't even know where to start. I don't say things like this lightly, but this is an amazing company filled with, by far, the best people I have ever had the privilege to work with. Prior to Coursera, I worked for a few startups of various sizes and stages and one large, well-known company. Those companies could only have dreamed of having a group of people as smart, driven, articulate, talented, collaborative, and happy as the people at Coursera. 

A few things:

— They are creating career paths for those on the technical side. I have never seen so much effort, especially at a company of this size, put towards creating ways for employees to grow.

— Cross-functional collaboration is HUGE and you can easily get access anyone in the company you need to talk to.

— If you have an idea, some guts, and a good case, it's possible to make a big impact.

— Minor in the grand scheme, but lunch and dinner are excellent. Also, we have no meeting Wednesday and many people work from home.

— I can't speak for anyone else, but I'm very happy with compensation and benefits. 

— A+++++ work/life balance. I was shocked to find out people actually use their unlimited vacation.

— In my experience, everyone I have encountered in management, including C-levels, are approachable and smart, yet humble. There's no ego here. 

I decided to post after I saw some previous reviews (that look like they were written by the same person). I don't doubt that person had a less than positive experience, but that is not even remotely close to the company I know.",1

- Peers: Supportive and trusting culture amongst peers. Of course people might have different opinions on tactics and ideas, but we all want what is best for our learners and partners education institutions, so we trust each others' motivations. Everyone is incredibly impressive and accomplished; I'm proud and honored to work amongst these bright folks. 
- Leadership: Leadership is inspired and inspiring. Also, I actually *like* them all as people; they are all *good* people. (No evil jerks like I've seen before at other startups.) I think they all complement each other well. I enjoy our weekly All Hands meeting where we can ask them any question we want and they have to answer. 
- Office Environment: Clean, large office with plenty of meeting spaces. Fun work environment with lots of creative Coursera-related decor. Lunch, dinner, snacks provided. Gym on site. Lots of fun activities like Monday Beer Club, Wednesday Supper Club, Friday Happy Hour, Talent Shows, office garden, Food Truck Thursdays, karaoke, ""Show and Tell"" Mondays (where people can give 5 min presos on something Coursera related or something totally random and cool), Tech Talk Tuesdays, international candy wall, etc.  
- Salary structure is what I find ideal: They hire people they expect that, in another organization, would receive their performance-based bonus every quarter on top of a base salary. Therefore you earn an annual salary that is reflective of a competitive ""base"", and then they add on what you might get from another organization as your performance-based bonus as your *total salary*. No performance-based bonuses; you get money no matter what as part of a *larger salary*. I think this makes the work culture have less pressure to fit goals made in the beginning of the quarter that always end up changing anyway! Hitting your goals is about personal fulfillment, supporting your team, and supporting the learners. If you aren't a top performer, you are letting more people down than yourself. 
- Product: Exciting product moves to the ""on-demand"" and more flexible style of learning for courses. Only edtech company with an Android app.  
- PR/Press/Marketing: Overall the press likes us and is supportive of our mission. We're still a ""hot"" startup, but there's recognized long-term potential from the media. It is easy to market a product one really believes in. 
- Community: Users (i.e., learners) love us and appreciate us, and they are vocal about letting us know this everyday. 
- Time-off: Unlimited PTO–FOR REAL. I've worked in offices with ""Unlimited PTO"" and they made me feel guilty every time I took off. Here managers encourage people to take the time they need, and people really use it as they need it. 
- WFH: They are also pretty friendly about letting people WFH on Wednesdays (during ""No Meeting Wednesdays"") and are flexible in letting you work within the hours that fit your working style best (all dependent on your teams and projects, as expected.)",1

"- edX is incredibly slow and bureaucratic for a small company. Every decision, including small ones, require layers of approvals before moving forward. This contributes to a terrible meeting culture where most of the company spends their days in pointless meetings vs executing. 
- edX will be a business school case study some day of a great idea and opportunity that went horribly awry. Don't let the headlines of the recent acquisition fool you. This was a fire sale. There was no path to financial sustainability. The acquisition was a necessary outcome for us to try and survive in the long-term. This was NOT the result of a successful, growing business. Our growth has been anemic across nearly every product line. We're constantly told and selling to partners that the next big thing is what is going to turn things around for us and them. We've finally reached a point where we've run out of rope after failures of Masters, MicroMasters, MicroBachelors, and many (many) more.
- No focus. We are constantly looking over our shoulder at what Coursera is doing and adapting our strategy to follow suit. Coursera is out executing us at every level, and with their recent IPO, will continue to widen the gap. They are easily 3-5 years ahead of us on product strategy, marketing, etc. Many of our partners have or are currently disengaging with edX to focus more of their energy on working with Coursera because of the ROI that they provide and the more advanced tools and features that have been built in the last couple of years. We have always been chasing the ""shiny object"" instead of focusing on our customers and executing on their behalf. Most of the tools that our partners (or learners) use haven't been improved or changed in years no matter how many times partners ask about it. They are finally fed up with it and many are taking their business elsewhere.",0

As a result you may randomly be understaffed bc they only want one person there and if there is a rush it's very stressful to serve and ring up by yourself.",0

"It has been an amazing ride ever since the first day I stepped into HQ.
From an almost week-long orientation process where we are immersed in the TOMS culture, to the giving trips where we get to complete the full circle in TOMS' ""One for One,"" it is a completely unique and gratifying experience that very few get to experience.  While it is true that employees are treated to all-you-can-drink latte's, on-campus happy hours, yearly company retreats, and amazing benefits, we are all expected to perform and place it all on the line day after day.

TOMS is still very much a movement and like any ripple in the water, the movement is continuing to grow. My coworker and I ask each other all the time if we've ever had those days where we really don't want to show up to work.  I'll write back here once the answer ever becomes 'Yes.'",1

"A common practice at TOMS is for new managers to push out existing workers and build out a new team. Like other reviews have stated, the new group of managers are poor culture fit at TOMS.  Individually, these managers are pretty useless and insecure. They establish relevance by pushing out old employees and gather support by hiring new ones.  This is a top-down approach that was executed at the highest level at TOMS. When the President was hired two years ago, he immediately hired a team of C-Level executives to report to him. Then each of these execs hired their own sets of VPs and then Directors and so forth. None of these positions were promoted from within TOMS.

This self-serving management tarnished the managers/employees relationship beyond the professional level.  As a result, gossip and clashes were formed and company became divided.  It deteriorated workers efficiency, core value and morale, which eventually impacted sales. I don't think TOMS can turn this around. 

Sure these things happen in all companies. But TOMS should have been the exception because it was built on employees values and working together for a cause. However, the employees who help built TOMS are all gone because of poor management. The real losers are the children/adults in need of TOMS giving shoes and eye treatments. At this rate, TOMS won't be able to provide to anyone but the greedy managers.",0

"Cruelty and short-sightedness: The layoff in Nov 2022 was handled very badly. Many long-time employees were dismissed overnight, with lots of knowledge gone with them, together with some cultural aspects that used to make Coursera a good place to work for. 

Shadiness: Coursera refuses to publish the exact number or percentage of the layoff, while many other companies do at the moment of layoff. 

Sneakiness: What's even worse than that, I (joined less than 1 year ago) was dismissed by Coursera due to ""performance issues"" right after the global layoff, although the manager used to give me pretty positive feedback before the layoff, and I was offered a tiny (less than 3 weeks) severance package, which I refused. In comparison, these laid-off employees got around 4 months of severance pay or more. By framing it as ""dismissal"" rather than ""layoff"", I think Coursera tries to circumvent government scrutiny and get away with paying less severance. And I believe I'm not alone. 

This shady business practice must be made known and punished. 

The severance they offered has violated the laws of my local jurisdiction and I am pursuing legal action against them. I was vigilant enough to keep some compelling evidence before termination. If you are also an ex-Courserian and want to sue Coursera, we can initiate a class action, though unfortunately I'm not allowed to share contact info on Glassdoor. I have posted it on Reddit, you can find it by googling.

This layoff is actually not the first time. When Jeff M. stepped up as the CEO in 2017, he laid off 40+ employees, many of whom contributed significantly to a round of funding they raised at that time. People might have forgotten, but in 2022, Jeff reminds us again of this. 

The company is no longer working on its real mission. It's now just pleasing the shareholders on the capital market. This layoff and the relevant shady, illegal practices make me seriously doubt the prospect of the company.

Most staff are underpaid. There isn't any transparency around the salary benchmarking process. The purpose of the benchmarking process seems like it is to save the company money rather than reward employees.
Bit of distrust around HR, again they come across as their concern is to protect the companies interest rather than the employees.

"It's unfortunate to see a company invest so much in ""culture"" and workplace aesthetics, but lack the foresight to see the void of employee growth and career pathing. Toms grew too fast and had no one to steer the ship. The talented executive team the once managed Toms was either let go due to direction change (owner wanting to expand his role and manage their department) or left. The company spoke of the Toms family and being part of the movement but at it's core was only concerned about profits and rapid continued growth. It's unfortunate to see such frustration at every level of a company from the executive team down to lower management. Toms is full of rumors and is built on a hierarchy of management that directs their team out of fear or personal goals. Internal rumors flare continually and talks of people being let go or quitting are a common occurrence. Employee turnover is always a clear indication of the performance of a company - and over the last 5 years the revolving door of Toms has seen almost an entire workforce come and go.",0

- ""Long-term Vision"", but short-term decision making. If something does not have immediate impact, it gets tossed aside. There is no strategic or practical go-to-market, it just exists on a google slide deck. 
- The leadership at Coursera is very weak. Most just look out for themselves, have no voice, don't push back, and agree to everything to keep their manager happy 
- The biggest red flag: 10%+ of the workforce was laid off before Christmas. Not longer after the layoffs, 'president club' was announced for the first time.

"This isn't every store, only the one I worked at in Park Slope, Brooklyn. 

You have to upsell a lot for the waffle cones, and they give you a talk if you weren't selling enough of them that week. It can be pretty annoying. They are very selective when it comes to applicants, but it's an ice cream shop. They treat working there like it's a bigger deal than it really should be. They were low on workers but had a stack of applications in the back office that they didn't even look at, which was infuriating because they would call me to work on days that I said I can't work. Also the people they would hire were terrible workers so they aren't as selective as they think they are. I was asked to work while I'm in class on multiple occasions because they were low on employees.  Once they brought in this woman who quit about 5 years prior because they had no one else. Even after I quit, my former boss was still calling me asking for me to work. I had to block his number.  They also try to cut corners when it comes to costs. The register is slow and outdated, the fridge sometimes has issues.  Among a great deal of other things that needs to be fixed in the store, they refused to fix it because they were low on money. The boss insisted on trying to fix everything himself.  
They were very shady about paying the managers what they were really owed (which really wasn't much only a dollar more than the other cashiers). They did a ton more work for barely any more pay, and they had to come in more for weeks of training.",0

- big issues around sustainability
- wages significantly below industry averages in many roles and departments.. discussion of salaries is frowned upon.  it's implicit  that you should feel lucky to work here and not be driven by money. as a result, attracts lots of  junior staff who need the line on their cv or don't have the financial pressure of kids, a mortgage, whatever. people expected to wear lots of different hats and work long hours for the love of it. But hand cream doesn't pay the bills.
- little opportunity for progression or career advancement
- financial incentives like bonuses, and promotions, are linked to 'goals', this is good in theory but in practice the goals are often hard to measure or quantify. performance review feels more like a check-box exercise
- global expansion of the last five or so years has left staff stretched across the board. retail staff frequently report feeling underresourced and under-supported. HR more focused on new hires than looking after existing staff, despite the platitudes",0

"My only complaint (and this is something of which many are aware) is that in such a collaborative environment, we have A LOT of meetings. The best way to handle it is to say no when you need to actually get stuff done. People understand.

This can be seen as a pro or a con, but I believe people need to be self-directed and self-motivated to be successful at Coursera. Also, priorities can change pretty quickly. Although there is a clear product roadmap, sometimes things don't work as expected and you need to adjust. That's just the nature of technology companies. 

Again, this can go both ways, but we work with some amazing institutions. This shouldn't be surprising, but universities don't move as fast or as open to change as people at a Silicon Valley startup would like. I bet some of the comments of slower-than-ideal forward momentum are tied to that.",0

Company has unreasonable expectations and has lost touch with consumers,0
Head office make some strange and non-sensical decisions,0
"1. Understaff issues: 
Understaff in the whole NY area, afraid to take sick leave because literally no one can cover for you. You feel bad for your coworker who is working with you that day. The hiring process is very lengthy, which helps HR find the most ""Aesop aligned"" person, but it also works against the company by taking too long to find proper support for staff that is already overworked and tired.

2. No room for growth, even harder if you were interested in another department:
I have seen too many talented people left the company (who were tenure and passion with strong KPI's). If you studied a major and had career goal within another department it is impossible for you to transfer, reason being you don't have experience, experiences you can't learn while you're in the store.... Aesop HQ love to  hire externally, including positions that made sense to hire internally (Store managers, Visual Merchandising positions) Retail consultants are there to train a new manager while acting like one and getting hourly pay. 

3. Store budget issues:
Most stores operate with mainly PT staffs, the excuse is that the budget for stores is not high enough to have more than one FT consultant and a store manager. Some stores have a  budget for ""Senior Retail Consultant"" (essentially, Assistant Store Manager)  but depending on how busy the store is, that may not be enough coverage on the floor. FT employees only get health benefits and not PTO, while senior retail consultants gets both. 

4. Responsibilities / Compensation: 
This is not the kind of job where you can just show up and clock in. There are a lot of small tasks you are required to complete even for a PT consultant, which can change if you work at a busier store that has no manager (which happens often). Upper management will say you're not responsible for certain tasks, but you may find yourself doing them anyway because if not the store won't be operating properly (responding to head office emails, ordering product, communicating with other stores for transfers, all this on top of actually selling and working the sales floor.)

"Indiegogo is truly a mission-driven company.

Though we are incredibly busy with the day to day operations of the company, people do not lose sight of our larger purpose: to increase access to capital, to democratize finance, and empower people to fund their passions.

Indiegogo also extends this empowerment to its employees. Even as an entry level analyst, I have been encouraged to pursue projects that I am interested in and have felt that I can impact the organization in a meaningful way. There is no shortage of work to be done so the team recognizes that strict hierarchy and red-tape impede progress. 

I have found myself working with some of the smartest and most friendly people I have ever met. Everyone is approachable and eager to see you succeed.  The more experienced employees will take time out of their busy schedule in order to meet with you and help you plan your career, provide advice and resources, or just to chat to get to know you. 

In summary, not only do you get to create meaningful change, you get to have fun while doing it with awesome people!",1

"-TOMS lost the fastball years ago and kept making the same mistakes over and over again rather than innovating. As the brand lost its place in the zeitgeist (and more important, the market) employees were tasked with more and more with fewer and fewer resources (financial or personnel). As a result the output became more stale and repetitive and left people burned out and uninspired, further depressing the brand image. These mistakes were compounded by spending money outside the company on terrible marketing campaigns rather than investing in the people and ideas within the building. Basically it was a pretty unfortunate (and avoidable) downward loop.",0

"Corporate leaders sometimes have lack of understanding of retail processes and systems first hand, with no former retail experience.

The company experiences normal issues regarding challenging sales months which can place pressure on store teams, though nothing unusual.

Upwards mobility can be challenging if you're not near a head office location or have other stores within your district.

Corporate teams seem to have a blurred line between work responsibilities. In many cases, corporate members push their work onto other corporate members or even onto retail teams; the in-store guidebook is helpful but sometimes hiring and facilitating the presence of a technician should fall into the hands of business manager, the vm team, or operations leader, and not a part-time retail consultant.

"Major imbalance in M/F representation on executive team. Executive meetings are basically bro-fests. Pay is not as competitive as other startups. Inexperienced leadership. Really top heavy. Promotions and title inflation are used as retention strategy which can of course be a plus if you're the person being promoted. On the other hand if you're the subordinate, you now have an inexperienced manager who probably has their own inexperienced manager. Blind leading the blind. Another side effect of this is that people leave after a short period of time because they leverage their new title for better pay somewhere else. They have old inefficient systems in place but are reluctant to break them down and start fresh and keep building on top of them instead. Too many short sighted decisions and experiments which they play off as pivoting and say ""we're so nimble"" instead of trying to learn from the mistake. People get hired specifically for these new ideas and then get fired when the project goes sour.

Before you take a job here ask your interviewer about the current team and then ask what it looked like 3 months ago. Ask why your position is open. A lot of people have been fired quietly or have left willingly over the past year. They ask you to write a Glassdoor review your first week so of course there are a lot of five star reviews.",0

Such a passionate and caring mission yet the company treats the average Joe like dirt. 
Only enjoyable to work here if you are part of the ""in crowd"",  and God help you if you are not. HR is THE WORST.
Inconsistent rules, depending on how well liked you are.

Disgusting and unethical. How do these people sleep at night?
No true accountability for Leaders. 
You will make a LOT of money if the RIGHT PEOPLE like you. 
You will never lose your job IF THE RIGHT PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
Your job performance can be substandard IF THE RIGHT PEOPLE LIKE YOU. 
Rules do not apply IF THE RIGHT PEOPLE LIKE YOU. 
HR does not want to hear how you REALLY feel and will sweep your concerns under the rug with all the rest. In fact, they will do their best to get rid of you if they find you to be a recurring thorn in their side. A ginormous (and well paid) team that provides...NOTHING.
Inappropriate and unprofessional behavior goes unnoticed and unpunished.
HR as a whole department has no clue nor concern about true employee satisfaction. 
The company is drenched in gossip, drama, negativity and low morale. People are so unhappy. You cannot trust anyone and the example of bad behavior is set by Leadership and infects the behavior of everyone else.
Yet, sadly, everyone plasters on a smile and speaks with forked tongues in order to collect a paycheck. 
Condescending behavior by everyone including Executives should NOT be tolerated. 
Why is there so much inconsistency in salaries among similar job levels?
Why are so many unskilled and inexperienced employees making significantly more than others in similar jobs?
Favoritism and nepotism is rampant.
Irresponsible and reckless spending, yet we should be thankful for our miniscule raises when Leaders are making their full salary in bonus?

"Since Bain has come into the picture the majority of C level and VP executives are no longer at the company. In some cases these positions have already turned over twice in three years. There have been a lot of layoffs over the past few years. Employees have been let go no matter what they've done or how long they've been employed. Women have been let go immediately upon returning from maternity leave. Quality people have been let go and jobs have been outsourced to more affordable countries. These are normal occurrences in corporate America but TOMS was supposed to be better than this. Was TOMS ever really better than the rest of corporate America? Treating employees poorly is not something that started when Bain came into the picture. Many years ago, at the peak of TOMS success people were still making an unlivable wage in LA. When the founder was approached and asked to pay people a little more so his employees could afford to live he said if you don't want to work here for what we're paying you then you can go work somewhere else. There are plenty of other people that want to work here. All employees were treated as though working at TOMS was some sort of privilege. With all that has been happening, the authenticity of why the company was started has been put into question. Was TOMS really started to make a difference in children's lives or just a social platform that was used to make a lot of money?
The culture has suffered dramatically with all the changes that have taken place over the past few years. Co-workers used to be like a family and now everyone just seems so sad to be here all the time. For most of us, coming to the office every day was something we used to look forward to, now it's dreaded. 
The brand name has been tarnished by selling so much product in stores like Ross. Once you saturate the market with $20 shoes people aren't going to pay $50 for them. There has been irreparable damage done to the brand. Consumers dont value it as highly and it will take a lot of work to turn it around. And it will take work, it's not going to happen just because it's TOMS.",0

Gaslights staff to feel they are valued and respected by giving all levels key holder responsibility when really this just removes the need to acknowledge and pay higher for supervisor roles. Staff product allocation is seen as a huge ‘gift’ to staff but probably costs the company less than a days wage to make those items. Terrible carbon footprint for product making but glorifies itself by being B Corp certified somehow.

Things can be chaotic, and I think people who have been here a long time take certain types of communication for granted—it’s much harder to keep 85 people informed than 15. Everyone has great intentions, but sometimes execution is lacking.

If you are willing to make your own way, you can accomplish a lot here. If you’re looking for someone to teach you how to do your job, you’ll probably be unhappy.",0
"Our smaller teams require greater hustle from everyone, but that simply gives each team member more opportunity to shine.",0

"I love most of the people at Coursera. They're really quirky, fun, and wicked smart to work with. In the early days it's also really satisfying to work in a company that provides free education. The benefits are really great too. A small gym, free food, and proximity to Mountain View Castro makes it even better. The mission to provide education to the world is amazing, although it's a bit sad to see that it's not a non-profit,  and leaning towards money money money these days.",1
There no cons working here,0
"Overbearing management, no work life balance, got lied to about pay",0
"It feels like working in a startup, since teams are smaller and everything you do will contribute to the ultimate success or failure of the business. Plus the company store is a good perk! Everything is half-off and comes in handy during the holidays.",1
"Flexible scheduling, amazing 50% employee discount and other benefits.",1
"The current leadership team before I left was very underqualified and didn't understand the market, team, or anything. They have made some very questionable decisions that has lead to the majority of the team leaving. They also didn't listen to feedback and micro manage everything",0

"Great strategy, strong culture, mission-driven and gets results",1
"The people here are amazing and not like any other workplace I have been in. They are so compassionate and smart and will stop at nothing to lend a hand to a fellow coworker. Management is also very helpful and there is lots of mutual respect between direct reports and their managers.
Along with the people, the benefits here are generous and way above the norm. Employees receive free catered lunch everyday and free T passes. We are technically employees of MIT so we receive all their benefits.
Additionally, this company is very open to new ideas and take their employees seriously. I have never felt this valued or satisfied in any other organization and I have nothing but respect for edX.",1
I can’t remember any cons,0
Not many cons to say.,0
"Pay was far too low, but not the worst I've seen in retail. Things changed on a dime, company layoffs, quick marketing changes with little to no notice/no materials or support for it. Major lack in labor support as well: high amount of freight with no hours to get it done, reprimanded for being off the floor or overusing labor to get it all done, often falling behind timelines and floorset execution because of that with no empathy or understanding from upper management. High expectation selling culture with low or no incentive (no commission, but top performers got better discounts). Vans was/is suffering financially and made a lot of cuts to things that are crucial for store teams to flourish: technology, leadership conference opportunity, labor again.",0
"The longer I’m with Aesop and the more senior I become, the more I see that many of the values that the company boasts are a hollow facade. There’s no doubt that my team and my peers are the sole reason I remain. Senior Management are obsessive and micro-managerial when it comes to revenue and you’ll fall out of favor very quickly when you stop delivering sales for any period of time. Often times, targets feel unachievable and you’ll struggle to reach out or admit to needing support as your worth is directly tied to your productivity. Don’t even get me started on the impossibility of growth if you’re not in the right city - it’s cruel to ask an employee to uproot their family to move as their only option to progress.",0

"The hiring process is beyond confusing, and honestly a little bit unprofessional. I've witnessed many great freelancers being led on with the hopes of becoming full-time, after putting at least a full year of hard work, blood, sweat, and tears, and in the meantime, many newcomers are being hired without even a hint of a probationary period. In addition, employees had been terminated with as little as a day's notice. I've also heard the words, ""Avoid walking in the main entrance when you interview. The girl you'll be replacing will know you're interviewing for her position if she sees you."" 
People have been leaving left and right. Certain new department leaders were clueless regarding their job descriptions, and are taking advantage of their new teams. It's a mess.",0
flexible schedule. fun. laidback. opportunity for growth.,1
"Repackaging should've been automated years ago. Most of the job is assembly line work, and immediate supervisors are temp workers who are often unqualified for leadership. Hours are not guaranteed, and can be twice what you were told or no work at all for weeks. Mundane work, poor conditions, daily schedule is designed to ""look"" appealing (i.e. 5-minute breaks) but actually creates an even slower environment. No freedom of movement, basic tasks like using the bathroom aren't technically prohibited but can't be done without halting production",0

As someone who likes to learn new things, I find this opportunity very compelling.

For a startup with this level of risk, salary and benefits are solid. Nice office. Too many office dogs for my tastes, but most people seem to like it.",1

"I personally had a great experience while at TOMS but mainly because I really loved my team. It was having to work with other departments that was the main problem. Lack of accountability runs rampant and it's incredibly difficult to do your job when other people expect you to do it for them. There is also a huge lack of processes which drives me insane... it still feels like a start-up in that sense. Prior to my leaving there were quite a few lay-offs. It was definitely necessary to eliminate some positions but it seems as though they got rid of some of the most dedicated and smartest people. Bad mistake. By the time I left, morale was at an all-time low. I have never felt so much palpable anxiety at any company I've ever been at - and I've been at some pretty down and out places before.",0

"In the past month, I’ve seen 6 coworkers break down in tears due to overwork and physical fatigue. 
That’s right. Grown men and women. Crying. At work. For an education company.
Coursera is a company in growth mode; hard work and stress should be expected. Where it gets weird is how employees are pressured to exude high levels of positivity, “wokeness”and inspiration while working long hours into the night, fighting for more help, and having their work criticized in public under the toxic mantra of “learn, change, grow”.
If you were to sit down and talk with any employee in private they would admit that they flat out hate their job and are actively looking for a new one. 

So why aren’t there more bad Glassdoor reviews you ask? It’s because most employees have stock allocations and don’t want to post anything negative publicly that affect the perception/value of Coursera.",0

Lack of uniqueness as the tasks tend to be the same day to day,0
"Management is very corrupt. They work out deals to help themselves gain notoriety and ""fame"". I am not proud to work for the management team as I have heard them use the one for one give as a ploy to get discounts on services, which would be fine if we were a non-profit business, however, TOMS is a for profit company. The day I overheard this was the day my view slightly shifted and allowed me to see the corruption. If any employee takes a step back and looks at the management team around or very close to them they will see patterns of corruption that go so deep. Employees are reviewed every 6 months, yet in the time I have been there, not once has anyone asked how I fell my manager is performing, or what it is that my manager can do to help me perform. If lead by example was taken serious this company would not exist. There are some good managers out there that try to make changes and do well for the company as a whole but more often than not they fall into the same corruption as the other managers in order to comply with the status-quo.

There are multiple layers of corrupt managers that work together to protect each other from the C-level threats. Unfortunately the C-levels are only knowing of what is being fed to them, which is a completely augmented truth. With the layers of management getting seemingly thicker and thicker it leaves little to no room for employees to get decent promotions or raises even if it be for cost of living increase. It appears that a majority of the desirable employees are leaving to go to places that they can actually grow and get paid fair wages. 

HR is another area that has major issues, as people slowly lose their names and become numbers HR is thriving and seems energized. Interaction with HR is a big risk as there is retaliation that happens all of the time. HR not only has an open door policy, but an open mouth policy when it comes to private information. Confidentiality is actually “can’t wait to tell my friend this story”. 

The culture and overall pulse of the company is so bad that a few years back they had to implement “culture captains”. They are basically bodies that HR has available to throw under the bus when things go awry. When I ask my captain what’s going on, they have some generic update that is fed to them and is obviously HR trying to use a familiar face to push off their ideas onto us.

In my pros I mentioned that the people I work WITH are a pleasure to work with, which is because the people that I work FOR are horrible people that I would expect to be slum lords or corrupt politicians. I recently saw a post about being a leader versus being a boss. If you want to work for a boss who only cares about themselves and you can deal with that and also deal with the fact that you know what you know today and just boarded the Titanic, please feel free to apply for my position when I leave.",0
"Small but mighty, TOMS has an amazing team. It's truly impressive to see how much can be accomplished by a targeted group of passionate people who truly want to improve lives through business. Outside of the adorable puppies, slides, ping pong tables at HQ, this is a business that truly balances the work hard/play hard mentality. TOMS ensures everyone is here for the same reason, even offering ""Giving Trips"" to employees, placing true meaning behind the work we do every day. Simply put, I’m proud to work at TOMS.",1
"Some of the leads (Sierra Nevada full-time employees wearing blue shirts) were very unprofessional. They made several inappropriate remarks about the customers during the working hour and was rude to the part time workers.

Lacks of leadership and management. The work was unplanned and unorganized. Often you will sign up for one role but then would put on a completely different role that you did not ever agree to do.

Managers show favouritism and if you do not fit the cult like culture within stores you will be isolated and singled out. If the manager doesn’t like you, there will be no training days that other consultants get which causes confusion.
